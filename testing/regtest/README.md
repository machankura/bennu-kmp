# Regtest network for the group Lightning wallet

A Bitcoin regtest network on one machine, for `GroupLightningRegtestJvmTest`: four devices open a
group Lightning wallet, receive, pay, close and sweep against a real lightning-kmp node and an eclair
LSP. What the run checks, what it found, and why each LSP setting is there is in
[docs/group-lightning-wallet.md](../../docs/group-lightning-wallet.md), "The regtest run".

The run is **not** part of `./gradlew check` or CI. Without `BENNU_REGTEST=1` the test is reported as
skipped, so a green `jvmTest` says nothing about it.

## Prerequisites

- Docker with the Compose v2 plugin (`docker compose`, not `docker-compose`)
- `curl` and `python3`, which `regtest.sh` uses to call the nodes and read their answers
- About 800 MB for the images, which the first `up` downloads: `bitcoin/bitcoin:31.1`,
  `getumbrel/electrs:v0.11.1` and `acinq/eclair:v0.14.4`. eclair 0.14.4 refuses a Bitcoin Core
  older than 31.
- These localhost ports free:

| port | what |
|---|---|
| 28443 | bitcoind RPC (`foo` / `bar`) |
| 28001 | electrs, Electrum protocol, no TLS |
| 29735 | the LSP's Lightning port, which the group's node connects to |
| 28080 | the LSP's API (password `lsp`) |
| 28081 | the payer's API (password `payer`) |

Nothing listens on any other interface, and the compose project is named `bennu-regtest`, so it sits
beside other stacks without touching them.

## Running it

From this directory:

```bash
./regtest.sh up
```

`up` starts bitcoind, makes three wallets (a miner, the LSP's, the payer's) and funds two of them,
starts electrs and both eclair nodes, and opens a 5,000,000-sat channel from the payer to the LSP. It
finishes by printing the LSP's node id. Allow a minute the first time, after the downloads.

From the repository root:

```bash
BENNU_REGTEST=1 ./gradlew :composeApp:jvmTest --tests '*GroupLightningRegtestJvmTest'
```

It takes about thirty seconds. It can be run again on the same network as often as you like. Each
run makes a new Lightning wallet with a new node. The group's onchain key is fixed in the test fixture,
though, so its first address collects coins across runs; the checks compare balances before and after.

When you are done:

```bash
./regtest.sh down
```

`down` removes the containers, bitcoind's volume and the network. The images stay cached.

To reach each piece by hand: `./regtest.sh mine 6`, `./regtest.sh btc <rpc> [args]`,
`./regtest.sh lsp <method> -d key=value` and `./regtest.sh payer <method> -d key=value`. The last two
call eclair's API, for example `./regtest.sh lsp channels` or `./regtest.sh payer usablebalances`.

## Where the output goes

- **The run's own lines and the node's log.** With Gradle's `-q`, or whenever the test passes, nothing
  reaches the console. Everything the test printed is in
  `composeApp/build/test-results/jvmTest/TEST-com.machankura.bennu.compose.managers.GroupLightningRegtestJvmTest.xml`,
  under `<system-out>`: the `REGTEST …` progress lines, lightning-kmp's log (`fr.acinq.lightning.*`),
  and the app's managers (`GroupLightningNode`, `GroupLightningCoSigner`, `FrostSigningManager`). The
  HTML report beside it, `composeApp/build/reports/tests/jvmTest/index.html`, shows the same.
- **eclair's log.** `docker compose logs` shows almost nothing for eclair, which writes to a file in its
  data directory:

  ```bash
  docker compose exec lsp tail -n 200 /data/eclair.log
  ```

  Use `payer` in place of `lsp` for the payer's.
- **bitcoind and electrs** log to the console: `docker compose logs bitcoind` or `docker compose logs electrs`.

## Troubleshooting

| what you see | what it means |
|---|---|
| the test is reported as skipped | `BENNU_REGTEST=1` was not set in the environment Gradle runs the test in |
| `The regtest network is not running: nothing answers for … on 127.0.0.1:…` | that service is down. Run `./regtest.sh up`, or check it with `docker compose ps -a` and its logs |
| `the payer has no open channel to the LSP` | `up` stopped part way through. Run `./regtest.sh down`, then `up` again |
| `up` prints `timed out waiting for: …` | a container exited: `docker compose ps -a` shows which, and its log says why |
| `timed out waiting for …` from the test | it lists the round-one label assignments and pool counts first (`REGTEST assigned …` and `REGTEST pool …` in the report). A pool counter with fewer than three rows is a co-signer that never answered. Otherwise look for `Error(` and `Warn:` lines in the node's log and for `WARN` in the LSP's |
| `Error(… data=…)` in the node's log | an error message from the LSP or to it. Its `data` is text in hex: `python3 -c "print(bytes.fromhex('<hex>').decode())"` reads it |
| `the payment failed: … route not found` | the LSP has no usable route to the payer. Check `./regtest.sh lsp usablebalances` and `./regtest.sh lsp allupdates`: an update with `htlcMaximumMsat` of 1 means eclair's balance thresholds were on when the channel opened (`lsp.conf` turns them off; `./regtest.sh lsp updaterelayfee -d nodeIds=<payer> -d feeBaseMsat=1000 -d feeProportionalMillionths=100` refreshes one) |
| a port is already in use | another stack has it. Change the host side of that port in `compose.yml`, and the matching port in `GroupLightningRegtestJvmTest` |
| the LSP refuses to start: `requires Bitcoin Core 31 or higher` | `compose.yml` was changed to an older bitcoind image |
