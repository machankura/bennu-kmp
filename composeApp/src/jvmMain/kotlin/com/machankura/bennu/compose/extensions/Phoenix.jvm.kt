/**
 * **Nothing is scheduled, and that has a consequence worth stating.**
 *
 * Android schedules two WorkManager jobs here: `ChannelsWatcher`, which wakes periodically
 * to check whether a channel has been force-closed while the app was shut, and
 * `ContactsPhotoCleaner`. Ios schedules neither and logs that it does not.
 *
 * The jvm has no equivalent, and not for want of an api -- a desktop application simply has
 * no process once its window closes, so there is nothing for a scheduler to wake. Running
 * the watcher in-process would be worse than not running it: it would only ever fire while
 * the app was already open and watching anyway, which is the case that needs no help.
 *
 * The exposure is real. A desktop wallet that stays closed past a force-close deadline does
 * not notice. Anything that closes it -- a system daemon, a scheduled task -- has to live
 * outside this process, which is why this logs rather than pretending.
