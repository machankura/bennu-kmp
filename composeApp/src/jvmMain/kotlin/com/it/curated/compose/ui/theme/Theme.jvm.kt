/**
 * Desktop has no portable contrast setting, and this reads the one platform that exposes
 * a usable signal through AWT.
 *
 * Windows publishes its high contrast mode as the `win.highContrast.on` desktop property,
 * which AWT surfaces on that platform and reports as `null` everywhere else. There is no
 * medium step -- Windows high contrast is a boolean -- so this answers
 * [ThemeContrast.High] or [ThemeContrast.Standard] and never [ThemeContrast.Medium].
 *
 * On linux and macos the answer is always [ThemeContrast.Standard]. macos does have
 * "Increase contrast" and linux desktops have their own equivalents, but neither reaches
 * AWT, and reading them means a native call per platform. **Until the app has a settings
 * screen this is simply unhonoured there**, which is worth knowing rather than papering
 * over: the setting should ultimately be a preference the user can override anyway,
 * since a desktop app cannot always see what the desktop was told.
