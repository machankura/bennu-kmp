/**
 * The desktop entry point, named by the `compose.desktop` block in build.gradle.kts.
 *
 * Two things differ from `MainActivity` and `MainViewController`, and both follow from the
 * jvm having no operating system keystore:
 *
 *  - the wallet seed is protected by a passphrase, so nothing can start until one has been
 *    entered (see [PassphraseGate]);
 *  - one directory is handed to both the curare and the phoenix context, so a single install
 *    keeps a single place on disk rather than two named after different projects.

 * before it is supplied: `keyStoreEncryption` and `keyStoreDecryption` throw until it is.
 *
 * **A new store accepts any passphrase**, since there is nothing yet to check one against. On
 * an existing store a wrong one is not detected here either -- it surfaces later, as a seed
 * that will not decrypt, when a data key fails to unwrap. That is a poor thing to learn after
 * the fact, and the fix belongs in the key store rather than in this screen.
