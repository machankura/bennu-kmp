/**
 * The derivation every member's device has to agree on, run against real FROST
 * tweaks.
 *
 * Nothing here checks arithmetic -- libsecp256k1 does that. What is checked is the
 * property the group depends on: two devices holding the same threshold key and
 * the same path arrive at the same key, without exchanging anything. If that ever
 * stops being true, members create rival admin rooms and neither can see the
 * other, so it is worth a test that fails loudly rather than a comment.
