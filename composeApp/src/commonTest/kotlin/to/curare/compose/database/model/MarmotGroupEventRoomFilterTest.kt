/**
 * Which room a stored kind:445 belongs to.
 *
 * `NostrEventDao.getMarmotGroupNostrEventsByChatRoomId` finds a room's group
 * events with `tags LIKE '%' || :chatRoomId || '%'`, because the tags are one
 * serialised column and there is nothing better to match on. That is a prefilter
 * and not a test: a group id can appear in a tag that is not the `h` tag, and an
 * event matched that way belongs to a different room entirely. Feeding one of
 * those to the replay would read another group's event against this group's MLS
 * state.
 *
 * So the reindex confirms `groupId()` in Kotlin after the query. These pin the
 * cases that confirmation is there for.
