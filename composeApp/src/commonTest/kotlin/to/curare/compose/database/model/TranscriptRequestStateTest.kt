/**
 * When a request line in a transcript stops asking for something.
 *
 * The transcript renders a request with a tint and a "Review" affordance, and
 * that is a promise: tapping it leads to a decision still there to be made.
 * Keeping the promise means knowing when the decision has gone, and the rows are
 * all there is to know it from -- a line rendered days later has no session
 * loaded, and the room may have signed several things since.
 *
 * A signing line says which session it belongs to, so those are read exactly. A
 * ceremony line, and any line written before that column existed, is read by the
 * clock, which is right for the one ritual a room runs at a time.
 *
 * Two ways for a request to be over, and they are not the same. Answering it
 * leaves a line of the reader's own and earns the tick. A session ending
 * underneath it leaves nothing of theirs at all: a member who declined published
 * nothing, and a quorum that signed without them wanted nothing. Both must drop
 * the summons; neither may claim the member signed.
