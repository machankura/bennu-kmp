/**
 * Where a commit's bytes land when the row that records it is written.
 *
 * `MarmotCommitResult` carries quartz's `CommitResult` payload fields verbatim --
 * `commitBytes`, `welcomeBytes`, `groupInfoBytes`, `framedCommitBytes`,
 * `preCommitExporterSecret`, the same names and all of them `ByteArray`. A value
 * taken from the wrong field of the right object therefore typechecks, and
 * `framedCommitBytes = commitResult.preCommitExporterSecret` reached the database
 * that way and sat there unnoticed: the column documented to hold a broadcastable
 * `MlsMessage(PublicMessage(FramedContent(commit)))` envelope held 32 bytes of the
 * group's pre-commit exporter secret instead.
 *
 * Nothing caught it because nothing read the column. The bytes that reached the
 * relay come off the in-memory `CommitResult`, so the wire stayed correct while the
 * record of it did not, and the row is written precisely so that the
 * acknowledgement path in `DatabaseNostrRepository` can pick work back up later. A
 * rebroadcast reading `framedCommitBytes` would have published noise the group
 * decrypts, fails to parse, and drops -- silent, which is this subsystem's
 * characteristic failure.
 *
 * So the routing is pinned here. Every payload gets a distinct, self-identifying
 * value: a field that ends up in the wrong column names both halves of the mistake
 * when it fails, rather than comparing equal by accident.
