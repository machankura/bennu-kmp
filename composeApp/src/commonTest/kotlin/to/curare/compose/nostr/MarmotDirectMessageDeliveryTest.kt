/**
 * What a device decides to do with an arriving wrap.
 *
 * This is where the check that replaces MIP-03 for kind:1059 is tested. The wrap itself
 * names nobody, so everything a transcript says about who sent a private message rests on
 * one comparison -- the seal's author against the identity MLS authenticated -- and if it
 * stops being made, a member can have their words attributed to somebody else, or
 * somebody else's attributed to them. The rest of the inbound path is Room-backed and
 * cannot be unit-tested here, which is exactly why the decision was separated from the
 * filing of it.
 *
 * `Ours` carries a second kind of risk. It is indistinguishable from `Unreadable` by
 * decryption alone -- we cannot open our own wrap either -- and getting it wrong does not
 * fail loudly: it files a placeholder over the only copy of the sender's own words.
