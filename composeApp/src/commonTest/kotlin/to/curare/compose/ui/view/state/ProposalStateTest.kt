/**
 * How a proposal is classified for the list, and what the classification is
 * allowed to disagree with.
 *
 * The screen asks this question in four places -- the section split, the row's
 * icon, that icon's description and its status line -- and the filter chips make
 * five. They used to each work it out from the stage and the approval
 * timestamps, which is how a chip comes to count a proposal the row beneath it
 * describes differently. So the classification is pinned here, before anything
 * renders it.
 *
 * What it must agree with is `FrostSigningManager.isAwaitingApproval`. That is
 * what the signing screen gates its two buttons on, so a list calling a
 * proposal settled while the screen behind it still offers a decision would be
 * hiding a decision rather than filtering one. [awaitsYou] is fed from it here
 * exactly as the view model feeds it, rather than being asserted by hand.
