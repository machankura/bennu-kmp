/**
 * Where a boot goes once it knows whose device it is on.
 *
 * `loadNostrProfile` is the only exit from a loading screen. Its callers
 * navigate to one first and then ask it where the user actually belongs, so a
 * pass through it that decides nothing does not fail -- it strands. The user is
 * left on a placeholder with nothing still running that would move them: the
 * startup screen has been navigated away from, so no wallet comes up, so the
 * flow that watches the wallet never emits again.
 *
 * That is what happened. The branch for a device that already had an account was
 * commented out when `NostrRepository.observeProfile` was renamed
 * `observeLocalAccount`, leaving only the no-account case doing any work. Anyone
 * who had ever made a profile could boot to "Introducing... Torch" and stay.
 *
 * So each of these starts the view model on exactly that screen and asks whether
 * the answer moved. Asserting the destination is the point, but the weaker
 * assertion underneath it -- that the state is no longer the one it started on
 * -- is the one the bug broke, and it is what makes a silently skipped branch
 * fail here rather than on someone's phone.
