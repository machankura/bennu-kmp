/**
 * When the signing screen offers to ask the members it is waiting on again.
 *
 * *Who* those members are is not decided here. That rule is the manager's, it is
 * not the same rule at every stage -- a nonce answers the question while nonces
 * are being collected and not after -- and the same reading decides whether a
 * resend publishes anything, so a second one here would be a second thing to
 * keep in step: a screen offering a knock the manager would refuse, or hiding
 * one it would make. See `FrostSigningManager.membersOwing` and the tests over
 * it in `FrostSigningResendJvmTest`.
 *
 * What is left here is when the offer stands at all, and the limits are what it
 * pins. The offer is the coordinator's and nobody else's: `acceptProposal` takes
 * a session's coordinator from the author of the proposal that opened it, so a
 * resend from anybody else would have a member who was missing the session
 * believe the resender coordinates -- and then drop the real coordinator's
 * signer set.
