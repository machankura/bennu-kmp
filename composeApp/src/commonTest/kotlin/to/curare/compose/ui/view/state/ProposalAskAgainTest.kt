/**
 * When a row offers to ask the quiet members again, and when it only looks like
 * it could.
 *
 * The offer is the coordinator's and nobody else's -- `acceptProposal` takes a
 * session's coordinator from the author of the proposal that opened it, so a
 * resend from anybody else would have a member who was missing the session
 * believe the resender coordinates, and then drop the real coordinator's signer
 * set. The row expresses that as a null rather than a zero: not ours to send is
 * a different fact from nobody left to send to, and only one of them could ever
 * become a button.
