/**
 * Where a tap on a proposal in the transcript lands, and which list it opens on.
 *
 * Three answers from two facts and a null, and they used to be a condition
 * inside a lambda nine levels down a `LazyColumn`. The decision matters more
 * than its depth suggested: one of the three is a member being handed their
 * queue instead of the proposal they asked for, which is only right because
 * answering the one they tapped and leaving would look exactly like being done.
 *
 * The filter is the new part. A tap held back *because other decisions are
 * waiting* should open on those decisions -- opening on the room's whole signing
 * history would be the same mistake in the other direction, since it was the
 * other decisions and not the history that the one proposal was withheld for.
 * An unnamed line gets the room, because it could be about anything.
