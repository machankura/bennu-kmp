/**
 * How far along a proposal says it is, and when it says nothing.
 *
 * The denominators are the ones the protocol actually gates on, not the ones
 * that happen to be nearby. `FrostSigningManager.orderedNonces` returns null
 * while fewer than `threshold` nonces have arrived and then takes the first
 * `threshold` of them, so the threshold is both what is needed and what gets
 * used -- the room's size is a bigger number that nothing waits for. Once the
 * signer set exists it is the set that is being waited on, which is the same
 * count arrived at from the other side.
 *
 * A figure that read against the room's size would sit at "2 of 5" on a session
 * that was about to complete, and one that read ahead of the coordinator would
 * sit at "3 of 2" on a session that was not moving. Both are worse than no
 * figure, which is why there is a test for each.
