/**
 * The pool's half of surviving a dropped socket.
 *
 * A subscription that outlives its socket only works if the pool remembers what that socket was
 * carrying and hands it back on reconnect. None of that is observable from the outside — no
 * return value changes, nothing throws — so a regression here looks like "messages stopped
 * arriving after a tunnel", hours later, on someone else's phone.
 *
 * The other half is that a relay answers a repeated REQ on an existing subscription id by
 * replacing that subscription's filter, which is what makes replay a send rather than a
 * close-and-reopen.
