 * and each rung is only unambiguous over a bounded span: a bare time means nothing on
 * a message from last week, a weekday means nothing past six days, and a day and month
 * mean nothing past a year. Reading a rung too far is the failure mode, and it is silent.
 *
 * Every case is anchored to the local day rather than to a fixed instant, because the
 * boundaries are local midnights and the test would otherwise pass or fail on the
