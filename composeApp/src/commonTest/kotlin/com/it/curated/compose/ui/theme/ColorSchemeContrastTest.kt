/**
 * Every colour pair the six declared schemes promise, measured.
 *
 * M3's accessibility foundation gives two thresholds: small text needs 4.5:1 against
 * its background, and large text or a meaningful non-text boundary needs 3:1. Disabled
 * states are exempt. See docs/material-design-conformance.md, "The numbers".
 *
 * This passes as written -- the generated palette is sound, and the tightest pair in
 * the tree is `onPrimaryContainer` on `primaryContainer` at 4.61:1 light. It exists so
 * that a later edit to Color.kt or to the wiring in Theme.kt cannot quietly break one,
 * because a broken pair is invisible in review: the two hex values look unrelated, and
 * the failure only appears on a device, in one theme, to someone who cannot read it.
 *
 * It walks the real `ColorScheme` objects rather than rebuilding them from Color.kt, so
 * it also covers the wiring. A role pointed at its neighbour's value -- `surfaceContainerHigh
 * = surfaceContainerHighestLight` -- is a plausible slip that reads fine in isolation.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* asserted here:
 *
 *  - **Monotonicity across the contrast ladder.** The obvious invariant, that
 *    high-contrast beats medium beats default for every pair, is false and correctly
 *    so. In the light high-contrast scheme `surfaceContainerHighest` goes darker to
 *    separate it from `surface`, which lowers its ratio against `onSurface` (13.30 ->
 *    12.29) while raising the one that matters. Ten pairs move that way. The floor is
 *    the invariant; the ladder is not.
 *  - **`outlineVariant`.** It reads 1.61:1 against surface, which looks alarming and is
 *    not a defect: M3's own baseline sits in the same range, and outlineVariant is a
 *    decorative divider. `outline`, the meaningful-boundary role, is asserted at 3:1.
 *  - **Call sites that pair two roles the scheme already covers.** Once
 *    `ProposalListScreen` derives its `ListItem` colours from its `Card`, the pairing it
 *    produces is `onPrimaryContainer` on `primaryContainer`, which the first assertion
 *    already walks. Restating it here would double the maintenance and catch nothing.
 *    What *is* asserted per call site is the composited case, below, because a
 *    translucent container has no ratio until it is put over something.
