/**
 * The stopping rule a reindex sweep runs on.
 *
 * A replay is worth doing at all because the events depend on each other: the
 * commit nobody could apply is what the room's later messages were waiting on.
 * That is also what makes one ordered pass insufficient, and what makes "keep
 * going" dangerous — a room full of events whose keys are gone would be swept
 * forever. Both halves of that are pinned here.
 *
 * The sweep never sees a database. What counts as recovered is whatever the
 * `isUnresolved` probe says afterwards, so these fakes are the real contract and
 * not a stand-in for one.
