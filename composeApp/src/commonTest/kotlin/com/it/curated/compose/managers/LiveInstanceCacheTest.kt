/**
 * The decision behind keeping an MLS group alive between messages.
 *
 * This cache exists because quartz drops a secret tree's skipped-generation keys
 * on save, so rebuilding a group between two messages loses any message that
 * arrives late -- permanently, and silently. See `docs/mls-skipped-keys.md`.
 *
 * Every one of these failures is invisible at runtime. Reuse too eagerly and a
 * group carries on from a ratchet another writer has already moved, which
 * corrupts decryption rather than failing it. Reuse too rarely and the cache
 * does nothing at all, and the bug it was written for comes straight back with
 * no symptom to notice. So the rule is asserted rather than reasoned about.
