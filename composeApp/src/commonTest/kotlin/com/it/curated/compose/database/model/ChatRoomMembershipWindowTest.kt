/**
 * Which of a group's kind:445 events are this device's to read at all.
 *
 * MLS hands a joiner the key schedule from their own epoch forward and nothing
 * before it, but the relay hands them the whole room. Everything the group
 * published earlier still syncs down and is still permanently unreadable, so a
 * member invited into a busy room opened it on a run of "Undecryptable Message"
 * above the conversation they were invited to.
 *
 * The epoch an event was encrypted under is inside the layer that will not
 * decrypt, so the only thing left to ask is when it was published. That makes
 * the boundary a judgement call rather than a fact, and the direction it errs in
 * is what these pin down: an unreadable event kept costs one refused decrypt, a
 * readable event discarded is a message the member never sees.
