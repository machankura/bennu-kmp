/**
 * What a birth certificate is allowed to convince a member of.
 *
 * A certificate is the whole of what a subgroup relationship is, so everything
 * downstream of it -- a `GroupKeyState` carrying a parent, a subgroup list, a
 * lineage shown to a user -- is worth exactly what `certifies` is worth. It has
 * a database nowhere in it on purpose: the deciding is pure, and pure is what
 * can be exercised exhaustively.
 *
 * Two halves again, and they are the same two `GroupKeyStateTest` names. A
 * certificate has to be **true** -- the id it certifies rederives from the key
 * and path it carries, so it cannot be pointed at a room that key did not make.
 * And it has to be the **parent's** -- signed by the room it names as parent,
 * which no single member of that room can do.
 *
 * The last test is the odd one and the most important to keep. It asserts a
 * certificate still verifies when its name and admin set have nothing to do with
 * the room's current ones, because those are the *founding* roster and the world
 * moves. A `certifies` that compared them would start rejecting valid
 * certificates the first time somebody joined a subgroup, and the rejection
 * would look exactly like a forgery.
