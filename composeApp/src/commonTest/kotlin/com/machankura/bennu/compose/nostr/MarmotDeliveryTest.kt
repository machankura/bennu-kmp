/**
 * Whether an encrypted group event actually leaves the device.
 *
 * The bug this pins did not throw, log, or fail a build. `MarmotOutboundDao`
 * wrote the broadcast rows inside `chatMessageOrNull?.let { }`, so an event with
 * no chat line pointing at it was MLS-encrypted, wrapped, persisted, its queue
 * row marked processed -- and never sent. FROST signing proposals and the room's
 * key announcement are exactly that: traffic the room generates, which
 * deliberately writes no ChatMessage of its own. Every proposal was silently
 * delivered to nobody.
 *
 * The DAO around this is Room-backed and cannot be stood up here, which is how
 * the gate survived unnoticed in the first place. So the decision is tested
 * where it can be seen, and the DAO does nothing with it but write what it says.
