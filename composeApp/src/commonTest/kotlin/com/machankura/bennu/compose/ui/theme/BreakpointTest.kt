/**
 * The breakpoint thresholds against M3's published values, and the spacing they select.
 *
 * The thresholds are the kind of number that is wrong silently: a layout that switches to
 * two panes at 640dp instead of 600dp still looks like a working layout on every device
 * anybody happens to test, and only misbehaves in the 40dp nobody opens. Asserting the
 * boundary from both sides is the only way that shows up.
