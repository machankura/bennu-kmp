/**
 * How a proposal's events go on the wire, and what an old build makes of them.
 *
 * The whole reason this encoding has two shapes rather than one is
 * compatibility, and compatibility is exactly the thing no other test in this
 * area can see: a build that predates batching is not here to be run against.
 * So the property is asserted from the other side -- a batch of one is byte for
 * byte the JSON object it always was, which is the only form such a build can
 * read.
