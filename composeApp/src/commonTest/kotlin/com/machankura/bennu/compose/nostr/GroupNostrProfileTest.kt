/**
 * What a group's nostr profile is allowed to be read out of.
 *
 * A room's id is the pubkey it signs as, so a kind:0 authored by that key is the
 * group describing itself and a kind:0 authored by anything else is not -- however
 * it came to be filed against the room. The reading is what the group detail screen
 * shows and what an edit is built on top of, so both halves are worth pinning:
 * which events become a profile, and what an edit does to the one before it.
 *
 * The edit half is the one with a silent failure behind it. `updateFromPast` is
 * used precisely so a field this app does not offer survives being edited, and
 * `createNew` in its place would compile, pass any test that only looked at the
 * fields the form knows about, and quietly wipe the rest of the group's profile
 * every time somebody fixed a typo in its name.
