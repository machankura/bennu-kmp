/**
 * What may be shown as something the group said.
 *
 * The reading gate is `GroupNostrProfileTest`'s -- the room has to be the author and
 * the signature has to be the room's -- and it matters more here than anywhere else
 * in this feature. A profile read wrong shows the wrong name; a post read wrong puts
 * words in a group's mouth under a byline saying a quorum agreed to them, on a page
 * whose whole purpose is to be read by people who were not there.
 *
 * The ordering half is the other thing worth pinning. Posts are the one statement
 * here that **accumulates**: kind:1 is not replaceable, so a second post stands
 * beside the first rather than replacing it, and everything the profile and the
 * relay lists do with "newest wins" is wrong for these.
