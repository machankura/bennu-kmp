/**
 * Who can open a gift wrap, and what becomes of everyone else's.
 *
 * NIP-59 encrypts a wrap under ECDH(ephemeralPriv, recipientPub), and
 * [GiftWrapEvent.create] discards that ephemeral key before it returns. The
 * recipient named in the `p` tag is therefore the only party who can ever unseal
 * one -- the sender included. Reading a wrap that is not ours is not a decryption
 * that might fail, it is one that cannot be attempted, and the code that tried
 * anyway threw `IllegalStateException: Invalid Mac` out of Nip44 and took the
 * enclosing Room transaction down with it, so the event was rolled back and
 * re-fetched on every later sync.
 *
 * These run real secp256k1 rather than recorded fixtures on purpose: the property
 * under test is about the key agreement itself, and a fixture would only prove the
 * fixture still parses.
