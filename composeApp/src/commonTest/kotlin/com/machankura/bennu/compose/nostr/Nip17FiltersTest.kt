/**
 * Pins the only gift wrap filter that can come back with something we can read.
 *
 * Every clause here is one that was got wrong in production. Two call sites asked
 * for `authors = [our pubkey]`, which cannot match a wrap signed by a throwaway
 * key and so returned nothing at all, silently, for as long as it existed. A third
 * asked for `p = [the peer]`, which returned other people's mail and crashed the
 * save that tried to unseal it. Neither failure was visible from reading the
 * filter, so the shape is asserted instead of trusted.
