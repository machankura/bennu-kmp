/**
 * What a room's key state is allowed to convince a member of.
 *
 * Two independent things have to hold, and the tests come in those two halves.
 *
 * A state has to be *true*: the room's id is the threshold key derived at the
 * path, so a state that does not rederive its own room is naming a key the room
 * was not made from. A member who acts on one signs with a share that cannot
 * aggregate, or worse, treats a key the group does not hold as the key the group
 * holds. That check knows nothing about who is speaking and never did.
 *
 * And a state has to be the *group's*: it is now produced by a FROST signing
 * session rather than announced by whoever made the room, so it carries a
 * signature no single member can make. That does not make a state truer -- the
 * derivation already settled truth -- it makes the first thing on a group's
 * record something the group agreed to.
 *
 * `GroupKeyStateManager` needs a database and so cannot be stood up here. What
 * can be is the deciding it defers to, which is where both halves live.
