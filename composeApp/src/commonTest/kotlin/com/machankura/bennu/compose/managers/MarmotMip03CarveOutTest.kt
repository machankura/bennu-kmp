/**
 * The one hole deliberately left in the author check, and its edges.
 *
 * An inner application event's pubkey must equal the MLS sender's credential identity,
 * which is what stops a member minting events attributed to somebody else. In a legacy
 * room a gift wrap cannot satisfy it -- its pubkey is a throwaway key that names nobody
 * -- so kind:1059 is exempt there, and the authorship claim moves to the signed seal
 * inside. In a current-profile room there is no exemption: a direct message travels
 * inside an envelope the sender authors, and a bare wrap is refused like any other
 * payload claiming an author it does not own.
 *
 * The exemption is the most dangerous line in this feature. Widened to another kind,
 * stripped of its kind guard, or extended to current-profile rooms, it hands every
 * member of every group the ability to publish events as anybody, and nothing else in
 * the pipeline would notice. These tests exist so that widening it fails here rather
 * than in a group.
