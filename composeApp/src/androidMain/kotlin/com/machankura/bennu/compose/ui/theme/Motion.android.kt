/**
 * Android has no "reduce motion" switch. What it has is **Remove animations**, under
 * Accessibility, and what that does is set the three animation duration scales to zero --
 * so the honest reading is `ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE == 0`.
 *
 * The platform already applies that scale to `ValueAnimator`, but **not to Compose**:
 * Compose animations run on its own clock and ignore it entirely. So an app that draws its
 * own transitions has to read the setting itself, which is what this is for.
 *
 * `TRANSITION_ANIMATION_SCALE` and `WINDOW_ANIMATION_SCALE` are the other two the switch
 * sets. Reading one of the three is enough: the accessibility toggle writes all three
 * together, and a developer-options user who has set only one has made a deliberate choice
 * about a different thing.
