 * The Lightning wallet's payment list says what the node's payments were, as lightning-kmp reports
 * them: a sent amount with its fee already in it, and a channel's close filed as an outgoing payment
 * with no payment hash. Found by the regtest run, which listed a close as "sent" and 20,000 sats with
 * an 84-sat fee as 20,084 sent. docs/group-lightning-transcript.md.
