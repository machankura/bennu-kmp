/**
 * NIP-17 rooms have no MLS group, no key packages and no invites -- membership *is* the p-tag
 * set on each message. Two properties follow from that, and both are load-bearing.
 *
 * The room id is [ChatRoom.deriveChatRoomId] over the member set, the same aggregate the
 * inbound path derives from an arriving gift wrap. That is what makes creation idempotent:
 * two people starting the same conversation have to land on one room rather than two, or the
 * same thread exists twice with each side writing into its own copy.
 *
 * And `mlsGroupState = null` is not incidental -- `sendChatMessage` reads exactly that to
 * decide between a group event and gift wraps. A NIP-17 room that acquired MLS state would
 * have its messages routed down a path no recipient is running.
