/**
 * The v14 -> v15 migration, against a real database holding the lines it exists
 * to clear out.
 *
 * Fixing the write path only stops the next one. Nothing rewrites a chat line
 * that is already in the transcript, so a member who joined a busy room a week
 * ago would go on opening it to the same run of "Undecryptable Message" -- one
 * per message the group sent before they arrived -- however many versions later.
 * That is the half of this migration worth asserting.
 *
 * What it must not do matters just as much. The delete is aimed at rows that say
 * nothing by design, and everything else in the transcript is the final word on
 * its group event: a message that was read, a commit that was applied, a line
 * this device wrote for something it sent. A rule with a join and a comparison in
 * it can take too much, and there is no undo.
 *
 * Run against the migration's own SQL on a bare connection rather than through
 * Room, the way `ChronicleRenameMigrationJvmTest` is: Room's version wiring
 * belongs to `PlatformDatabaseBuilder` and is the same for every migration in
 * that list.
