/**
 * The notary's unsigned queue, and what an event it cannot publish does to the rest.
 *
 * The last of the three queues to hand back one row at a time, and the only one already
 * observed to stall: the comment on `NostrDao.commitPublishedNostrEvent` records an indexing
 * throw rolling `signedAt` back, after which nothing queued behind that row was ever signed --
 * "including the MLS key package, which is enqueued last". That was closed by moving indexing
 * into its own transaction (covered in [NostrDaoJvmTest]), which fixed the one known way in
 * and left the queue as narrow as it was.
 *
 * These cover the width instead. `signedAt` is the only exit, so a row that cannot be
 * published stays; what matters is that it is no longer the only row the notary is shown. The
 * kinds used are the ones a real account queues -- 0 metadata, 3 contacts, 10012 relay feeds
 * (the one carrying `privateTags`, and so the only one whose publish encrypts first), 10050
 * and 10051 relay lists, 30443 key package -- because their sort order is the whole reason a
 * stall in the middle of that burst leaves a user nobody can reach.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the DAO's half: that the backlog arrives whole and in a stable
 * order, and that publishing some rows neither disturbs nor depends on the others. The loop
 * that walks it lives in NotaryViewModel, which wants an Identity flow to stand up; the
 * [drain] below is shaped like it but is this test's own, so it pins the queue rather than the
 * collector.
