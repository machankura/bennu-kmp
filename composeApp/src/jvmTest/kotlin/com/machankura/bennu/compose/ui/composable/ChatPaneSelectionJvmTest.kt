/**
 * The detail pane follows the selection.
 *
 * On a phone a room is a route, and every push is a back stack entry with a
 * `ViewModelStore` of its own: `viewModel()` in the room screen finds nothing under its
 * key and builds from the factory it was handed. In an expanded window the pane is not
 * pushed. Every room it shows is composed under the home destination's one entry, and
 * `viewModel()` there found the *first* room's view models and handed them back with the
 * factory unread -- so the transcript stayed on the first room opened while the list
 * went on to another. Keying the composition on the room did not help; it is the store
 * that has to be keyed, and [ChatPaneLayoutJvmTest] cannot see that because it never
 * opens a room.
 *
 * The rooms are told apart by what was said in them rather than by their names, because
 * a name is on the list row as well as the transcript's bar, and the row was the one
 * thing that was right.
 *
 * The third test is about the fix rather than the bug. Keying the `viewModel()` calls
 * on the room would pass the first two, and keep every room ever opened -- observers and
 * all -- in the home entry's store for as long as the home screen lives. A store per
 * room is cleared when the pane moves on, and the way to see that from outside is that
 * the room left behind stops collecting its messages.
