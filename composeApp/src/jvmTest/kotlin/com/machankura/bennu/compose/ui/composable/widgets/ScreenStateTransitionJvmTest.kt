 * That a screen's state change is a transition rather than a cut, and that ordinary data
 * changes are not.
 *
 * Both halves matter and the second is the one that is easy to get wrong. `AnimatedContent`
 * keyed on the state *value* would re-run the whole fade every time a loaded list grew by
 * one row -- a screen that flickers whenever a message arrives -- and it would look
 * entirely correct in any screenshot. Keying on the state's class is what separates "the
 * screen is now answering a different question" from "the answer got longer".
 *
 * The clock is held still so a frame in the middle of a transition can be inspected. That
 * frame is the whole test: during a crossfade both states are composed, and during a cut
 * only ever one is.
