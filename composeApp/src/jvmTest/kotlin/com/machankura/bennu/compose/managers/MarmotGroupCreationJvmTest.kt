/**
 * What the device that *creates* a room knows about it afterwards.
 *
 * `Participant.adminAt` is written in exactly one place --
 * `MarmotInboundManager.processGroupMembershipChanges`, on an arriving commit --
 * while the rows a creator makes come from `getOrCreateChatRoom` and
 * `addMembers`, neither of which sets it. So a room whose epoch-0 context names
 * its admins had none of them flagged on the one device certain to be one, until
 * some *other* member sent a commit.
 *
 * It read as a permissions bug: "only an admin of this group can make a
 * subgroup", said to the admin who had just made the group.
 *
 * The guard now reads `MarmotGroupData` instead, which is right on both sides
 * from epoch 0 -- but the column is still what the UI labels members with, so it
 * is caught up here too.
