/**
 * The string catalogue reads back what the source used to say.
 *
 * Moving 315 literals out of composables and into `strings.xml` is a rename that a
 * compiler cannot check: every call site still compiles if a resource holds the wrong
 * text, and the mistake surfaces as wrong words on a screen nobody has opened.
 *
 * The escapes are the part worth a test rather than an assumption. A string going into an
 * XML resource needs `'` escaped as `\'` and `%` doubled, and the generated `.cvr` stores
 * the escaped form verbatim -- base64 of `We couldn\'t find...`. Whether the backslash is
 * still there when `stringResource` hands the text to a `Text` is a property of the
 * resources library, not of the extraction, and the failure mode is an app that literally
 * displays `Don\'t sign`.
 *
 * `getString` is the non-composable reader for the same resources, so this can assert it
 * without a composition.
