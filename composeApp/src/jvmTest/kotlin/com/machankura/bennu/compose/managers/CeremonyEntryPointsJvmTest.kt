/**
 * A key ceremony is started in exactly three places, each of which knows what
 * the ceremony is for.
 *
 * - group creation (`SelectChatRoomTypeViewModel`), a new group's own key;
 * - the subgroup picker (`SelectSubgroupAdminsViewModel`), a subgroup's key,
 *   held in its parent's room;
 * - `CreateSharedKeyViewModel`, an existing NIP-17 group that has no key yet.
 *
 * A fourth used to exist: the ceremony screen offered "Start key ceremony" from
 * the same button slot its approvals used, and a member coming back from
 * approving a subgroup's ceremony opened a second, whole-room one in the
 * parent's room. See docs/ceremony-creation.md.
 *
 * This counts calls rather than proving anything about them, which is the
 * point: it fails the day a fourth appears, so that adding one is a decision
 * somebody makes here rather than a button somebody adds to a screen.
