/**
 * The member rows on the room's screen, and what one opens.
 *
 * A row is a promise about the screen behind it, and this one was a stub for long
 * enough that the promise is worth pinning: a member opens the profile preview,
 * keyed by the member's public key, with the active identity beside it so the
 * preview can say whether a chat with them already exists.
 *
 * Two members, because the screen names them differently and the row has to open
 * the same screen either way. One has a profile and is named by it. The other has
 * none yet -- the "LOADING..." row `MemberProfileSync` exists for -- and is named
 * by the key; that member is the reason the row opens the preview rather than the
 * profile detail, which is keyed by a kind 0's event id and has nothing to open for
 * a member whose kind 0 has not arrived.
