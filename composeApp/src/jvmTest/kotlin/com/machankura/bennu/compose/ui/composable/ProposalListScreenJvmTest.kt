/**
 * The chip row over the proposal list: what it offers, what it counts, and what
 * tapping one does to the rows beneath it.
 *
 * **Every state is offered, with its own number.** A chip is present at zero
 * too, which is the decision worth testing rather than the obvious one: the
 * alternative is a row that gains and loses chips as sessions advance, and
 * sessions advance while this screen is open -- somebody else signing is exactly
 * when a member comes to look at it.
 *
 * **A filter flattens the screen.** Unfiltered, the two sections stay, because
 * what is waiting on the reader reads differently from what the group has done.
 * Filtered, the headings go: the reader has already said which they want by
 * tapping, and heading a single-state list with "waiting for you" would answer a
 * question nobody asked.
 *
 * **An empty filter says which emptiness it is.** One shared "nothing found" is
 * how five different absences here came to say one thing. A group never asked to
 * sign and a queue the reader has worked through are not the same fact, and the
 * second is not an absence at all.
