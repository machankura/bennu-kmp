/**
 * Two devices, two databases, one real signing session, and the wire between
 * them held by hand.
 *
 * Everything else about signing is checked in pieces: `FrostSigningRoundTest`
 * runs the FROST calls, `GroupKeyStateTest` judges a finished state, and
 * `SignedArtifactTest` turns a signature into rows. None of them can see the
 * claims that only exist *between* devices, and those are exactly what this
 * change is made of:
 *
 *  - a room's key state is not written by whoever creates the room, it is
 *    signed into existence by a quorum and lands on every device at once;
 *  - both devices resolve the room's derivation path independently and arrive
 *    at the same event id, without either being told what it is;
 *  - what they sign as is the room's own key, so the author on the finished
 *    event is the id of the room it was signed in.
 *
 * The transport is the only thing faked. `FrostSigningManager.broadcast` queues
 * a `MarmotInnerEvent` for the outbound pipeline to encrypt, so ferrying those
 * rows between two databases *is* the group, minus MLS -- which has no opinion
 * about any of the above.
