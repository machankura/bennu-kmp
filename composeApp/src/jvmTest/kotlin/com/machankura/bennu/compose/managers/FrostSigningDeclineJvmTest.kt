/**
 * What one member's refusal does to a signing session, against a real
 * database and the real manager.
 *
 * A t-of-n key needs t willing members, not n, so a refusal used to do far
 * more than it should: one member pressing "Don't sign" ended the session for
 * everybody, in a group whose whole reason for running a ceremony was that no
 * one member is needed. Now a refusal takes one member out of the n, and the
 * session is abandoned only once fewer than t are left -- in the 2-of-3 group
 * here, on the second refusal and not the first.
 *
 * Every device counts for itself, from the refusals it has received, and the
 * count is checked from both sides: refusals arriving from other members, and
 * this device's own, which is recorded as a decision and published the way an
 * approval publishes a nonce.
