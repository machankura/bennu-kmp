/**
 * The outbound queue. Nothing else drains this table, so a row it fails to hand back is an
 * event that is never sent to any relay -- and the failure is silent, because a queue that
 * returns nothing looks exactly like a queue that is empty.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical here. The observer's predicate used to carry a `createdAt > :now`
 * bound whose `now` was evaluated once, when the Flow was built. Instants persist at second
 * resolution, so it hid every broadcast enqueued during the observer's own start second -- the
 * whole profile-creation burst -- along with everything a previous session had left pending.
