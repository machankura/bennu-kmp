/**
 * The chat list's order and its previews both come out of one query, so a single wrong
 * join reads as two unrelated bugs: rooms sorted by nothing anybody can see, and a row
 * quoting a message that is not the newest one in it.
 *
 * The parts that can only be checked against a real SQLite are here -- which row the
 * correlated subquery picks, and how the ordering treats a room nothing has been said
 * in. What the picked row is then rendered as is [com.machankura.bennu.compose.database.model.intermdiate.LocalChatRoom]'s
 * own business and is tested against it directly.
