/**
 * What a parent's own record says about its children, and what it refuses to say.
 *
 * There is no table of subgroups. The certificates *are* the record -- the
 * group's own signed statement, checkable without a lookup, and held by every
 * device that followed the signing session rather than only by the signers. So
 * everything a parent knows about its children is a read over
 * `GroupSignedEvent`, and these are the properties that read has to have.
 *
 * The negative cases carry the weight, as they do for chronicles. A list built
 * from signed events is only as safe as its filter: a member can put a rumor of
 * this kind into the room, and a real certificate signed by some *other* group is
 * a valid signature over a true-looking statement with no standing behind it.
 * Neither may reach the list.
 *
 * The one positive case that matters as much is a certified child whose room this
 * device does not have. That is the normal position of a parent member who is not
 * in the subgroup, and of everybody between the certificate being signed and the
 * room being created -- so a list that could only show rooms would be empty
 * exactly when it is most needed.
