/**
 * What a group gets for choosing "robust": the key ceremony its room opens with.
 *
 * The quorum picked while creating the group has nothing in NIP-17 to govern --
 * there is no group state to change, and a different member set is simply a
 * different room -- so the only thing that can carry it is a t-of-n key the
 * members generate together. Everything that ceremony needs is settled the
 * moment the room exists, so `SelectChatRoomTypeViewModel.createNip17ChatRoom`
 * opens one there and then rather than leaving it for somebody to find a button
 * for. These are the properties that has to hold to.
 *
 * The proposal being the room's *first* event is not a nicety. Standing up a
 * NIP-17 room sends nothing to anybody, so until something goes out the group
 * exists on one device only; the proposal is what the other members hear the
 * room from at all, which is why `NostrDao` builds the room from a DKG payload's
 * p-tags on the way in.
 *
 * The view model itself is not exercised here -- it needs a wallet's key manager
 * and a Compose runtime -- so what stays uncovered is the wiring: that the
 * quorum reaching [ChillDkgRitualManager.proposeRitual] is the one the picker
 * holds, and that a null session leaves the user on the creation screen.
