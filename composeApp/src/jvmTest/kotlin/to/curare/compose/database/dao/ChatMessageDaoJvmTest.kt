/**
 * `getResolvedMarmotGroupEventIds` is the query a reindex sweep subtracts from the room's
 * stored group events to decide what to replay, so its answer decides what work the sweep does.
 * Both ways of being wrong are quiet. Report an event as resolved when it is not and the replay
 * skips the one event that needed it -- the message stays missing from the feed with nothing
 * left to trigger another attempt. Report it as unresolved when it is resolved and every sweep
 * re-decrypts it forever.
 *
 * The distinction rests entirely on `messageType NOT IN (:unresolvedTypes)`, where the
 * unresolved types are the two placeholder lines that stand in for a message still to come
 * rather than reporting one.
