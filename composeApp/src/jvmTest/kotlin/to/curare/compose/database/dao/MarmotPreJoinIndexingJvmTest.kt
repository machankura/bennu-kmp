/**
 * What a room does with the kind:445 events the group published before this
 * device was in it.
 *
 * They arrive whatever anyone wants: MLS gives a joiner the key schedule from
 * their own epoch forward, the relay gives them the whole room, and negentropy
 * syncs the lot down on first open. Every one of those events is permanently
 * unreadable, and reading them anyway is what put a run of "Undecryptable
 * Message" above the conversation a member had just been invited to.
 *
 * Asserted at the DAO because the decision is only worth anything where the
 * backlog is: `indexMarmotGroupEvent` for the events as they land, and
 * `reindexMarmotGroupEvents` for the replay that would otherwise spend a refused
 * decrypt on each of them every time a member asks a room to try again.
 *
 * The room here has no MLS state, so nothing this replays can be read. That is
 * the point: it separates events left alone because they predate the join from
 * events tried and failed, which is the whole distinction under test.
