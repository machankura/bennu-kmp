/**
 * The membership guards on [MarmotOutboundDao].
 *
 * Both entry points that change a group's membership begin by restoring the MLS state off the
 * ChatRoom row, and a room restored from an inbound gift wrap has none -- there is nothing to
 * add a member to. The comment on `inviteMemberToChatRoom` says the point of the throw is to
 * "say so instead of silently doing nothing and letting the caller report success", which is a
 * claim about behaviour and therefore testable: a guard that returned quietly would still
 * compile, still look like it worked, and leave a room whose members believe someone was
 * invited.
 *
 * Past the guard, the tests build a real MLS group and a real peer key package with
 * [marmotKeyPackageFor], so the commit, the epoch advance and its persistence are exercised
 * rather than described. Nothing there needs a relay: a key package is three local key
 * generations and two signatures.
