/**
 * The outbound queue the notary drains, and what a message it cannot send does to the rest.
 *
 * Nothing takes a row off this queue but a successful send: `encryptAndSendMarmotInnerEvent`
 * stamps the row with the group event it became, in the transaction that writes that event.
 * So a row that can never be sent never leaves, and while the queue handed back one row at a
 * time, that row was the queue. Every message behind it -- in every room the key belongs to,
 * because the filter is the sender rather than the room -- waited on a send that was not
 * coming, and showed in the chat as unsealed for as long as the user cared to look.
 *
 * These stand the two rooms side by side: one holding real MLS state, one holding none, which
 * is the shape a room restored from an inbound gift wrap has. The unsendable row is queued
 * *first* on purpose. Under the old queue it was the only row the notary ever saw.
