/**
 * The keys an ancestor group holds in a subgroup's wallet, and the leaves they
 * sit in.
 *
 * Every group has one guardian root, a tagged HMAC away from its threshold key,
 * which it never hands out. What a parent writes into a child's birth
 * certificate is that root one public BIP32 step further, at an index taken
 * from the child's room id -- and, behind it, every key the parent's own
 * ancestors gave the parent, each one step further at the same index:
 *
 * ```
 * I        = HMAC-SHA512("bennu/group-wallet/guardian/v1", serP(K_A))
 * R_A      = K_A + I[0:32]·G,  chain code I[32:64]        A's guardian root
 * i(C)     = taggedHash("bennu/group-wallet/guardian/child/v1", C)[0:4] & 0x7fffffff
 * grant(C) = [R_A/i(C)] ++ [g/i(C) for g in grant(A)]     nearest first
 * L        = xonly(g / network / account / change / index) a leaf key in one address
 * ```
 *
 * See `docs/group-wallet-guardians.md` for why each step is what it is. In
 * short: a fresh key per child is what lets the parent *agree* to guard it, a
 * root nobody publishes is what keeps a guardian spend unlinkable to a Marmot
 * room, and re-deriving every inherited key per child is what keeps a parent's
 * wallet and its child's from sharing a leaf.
 *
 * ### The same rule as the wallet's
 *
 * Every step is a public tweak of the threshold key, so a leaked leaf private
 * key recovers the group's threshold key. Nothing reconstructs one: a leaf is
 * signed for by a FROST session over [signingCache].
