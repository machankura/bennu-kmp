/**
 * Building the group's signed record into pages a member who lacks it can apply.
 *
 * See docs/member-chronicle.md. The short of it: a member added after the work was
 * done has none of it and never will, because a group-signed event is applied
 * locally by each device that took part and never goes on the wire. This is how
 * it gets to them.
 *
 * ### Carrying nothing, for now
 *
 * What a chronicle may carry is [ChronicleEvent.KINDS], and that is empty since
 * the document kinds it was built for were removed (docs/ceremony-creation.md,
 * Phase 7). Every entry point here takes the kinds as a parameter defaulting to
 * that list, and with it empty the chronicle is quiet: [requestIfEmpty] asks for
 * nothing, [sendTo] sends nothing, and a page from an older build applies
 * nothing. The machinery is kept, and tested with a list of the tests' own, for
 * the next kind that should join.
 *
 * ### The events are the chronicle
 *
 * `GroupSignedEvent` holds what the group signed, as it signed it, so
 * [signedEventsOf] reads it: no rebuild, no round-trip risk, and nothing that
 * depends on a row having kept every field of the event it came from.
 *
 * **The allowlist does real work on the way out.** The table holds everything
 * the group has ever signed, `GroupKeyStateEvent` included. So [signedEventsOf]
 * filters on the kinds before anything else, which is the same rule [applyPage]
 * applies on the way in. Without it `ChronicleEvent.build` would refuse the page
 * and take the whole chronicle down with it. What the filter is really stopping
 * is a member replaying any group-signed statement about the record as though it
 * were work, and [applyPage] refuses the same kinds coming the other way. The two
 * are a pair and neither is safe to drop on the strength of the other.
 *
 * ### Nothing unverifiable leaves
 *
 * Every event is checked with [GroupKeyStateEvent.isSignedByRoom] before it is
 * packed, against the same room id the recipient will check it with. That is not
 * politeness towards the receiver, who checks anyway. It is what keeps a
 * chronicle honest about its own size: dropping a payload here rather than
 * letting the recipient drop it means the page count says what will actually
 * arrive.

     * into the room has processed its Welcome.
