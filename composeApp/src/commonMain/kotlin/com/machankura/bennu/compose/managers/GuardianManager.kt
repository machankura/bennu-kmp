/**
 * What an ancestor group knows of the guarded wallets beneath it, and how it
 * comes to know.
 *
 * A descendant opens a guarded wallet in its own room. Its ancestors are not in
 * that room, so a member who sits in both carries the signed statement across
 * as a [GuardedWalletNoticeEvent]; every device in the ancestor's room checks it
 * for itself, and from then on watches the wallet and can propose spending from
 * it through its own leaf. See `docs/group-wallet-guardians.md`, "How an
 * ancestor finds the coins".
 *
 * A notice forwarded into a middle group can be forwarded again from there, so
 * a root needs a member in common with each generation, not with the grandchild.
