/**
 * Deletes the raw-JSON bubbles the group Lightning wallet's own messages left in the chat.
 *
 * Every kind the wallet's devices send each other -- the Iceberg ceremony, the co-signing,
 * the operator's snapshots and invoices -- reached `ChatMessage.applyInnerEvent`'s last arm
 * and was written as an `unsupported` line holding the event's JSON, attributed to whoever
 * sent it. They are found the way `MIGRATION_26_27` found the ceremony's raw-hex ones: by
 * the kind of the inner event behind them. See docs/group-lightning-transcript.md, Phase 1.
 *
 * Only those. The three kinds the group signs had lines of their own and never left a
 * bubble, and an `unsupported` line over any other kind is still the only trace an
 * unrecognised payload leaves.
 *
 * No shape changes, so Room's schema for v33 is v32's.
