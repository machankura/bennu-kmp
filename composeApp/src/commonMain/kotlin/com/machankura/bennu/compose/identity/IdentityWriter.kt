/**
 * Puts a new identity on disk, one function per kind, and prepares the per-identity
 * preferences every kind reads.
 *
 * [writeMnemonic] was an `expect` with three byte-identical actuals -- android, jvm, ios --
 * using nothing but commonMain: SeedManager, EncryptedSeed, LocalKeyManager,
 * DataStoreManager, AppVersion. It was an expect because something once needed to
 * differ and nothing does now, so it is one function here, and the second writer sits
 * next to it rather than being triplicated in turn.
 *
 * All three refuse a duplicate **by nostr public key**, not only by id. A wallet and an
 * imported key can be the same npub under different ids -- one is hash160 of the node
 * key, the other hash160 of the nostr key -- and the database is keyed by pubkey, so two
 * identities for one pubkey would share every row and disagree about which is active.
 *
 * With two exceptions, which are the point of the credentials file. A public key already
 * here read-only is not a duplicate of the secret that signs as it: the device does not
 * have that secret, and refusing it would be false. [writeNostrKey] replaces the entry
 * in one write. And a bare secret already here is not a duplicate of the recovery phrase
 * that derives it: the device does not have that wallet, and pasting the phrase is the
 * profile acquiring the wallet that derives it. [writeMnemonic] writes the credential
 * first and then the seed -- see docs/multiple-profiles.md, Phase 1 -- and every seed's
 * key is a `Secret` entry in the credentials file, so that the file is the list of
 * profiles and the seed is a wallet attached to one of them.
