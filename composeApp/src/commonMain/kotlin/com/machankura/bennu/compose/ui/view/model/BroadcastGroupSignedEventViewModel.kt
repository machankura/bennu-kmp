/**
 * One event the group signed, sent to the relays a member picks.
 *
 * Signing and sending are two acts here, on purpose. `FrostSigningManager.complete`
 * files what a quorum signed and applies it locally, and nothing leaves the device;
 * this is the second act, taken by a member, one event at a time, to relays they
 * can see and change before pressing the button. What goes on the wire is the
 * event exactly as the group signed it -- the signature is the group's, so any
 * member holding the event can send it and no share of the key is needed.
 *
 * The send itself, [sendToRelays], is also what the entries screen's "Broadcast
 * all" uses, one entry after another and each to the relays [defaultRelaysFor]
 * would have seeded here; what is this screen's is the list the member edits
 * and the rows that show each relay's answer.
 *
 * ### Why not the broadcast queue
 *
 * Everything the app publishes as itself goes through `BroadcastNostrEventRequest`,
 * which is durable, retried and drained in the background. It is not used here
 * because it hangs off a `NostrEvent` row, and a row for the group's event is
 * more than a queue entry: the home feed selects by kind, so the group's post
 * would appear in it as if it were anybody's; and the sync loop offers every
 * local event id to the relays it reconciles with, so the event would reach
 * relays this screen never named. `GroupSignedEvent` explains at length why it is
 * not a `NostrEvent`; this keeps that true. The cost is that a broadcast is only
 * as durable as the button press -- what each relay said is shown, and a relay
 * that did not answer is sent to again by pressing again.
 *
 * ### Where the relays come from
 *
 * [defaultRelaysFor]: the group's own General list where it has agreed one, the
 * app's publish set where it has not, plus the indexers for a relay list, minus
 * anything the group has blocked. The member can add and remove before sending, and the
 * seeded list is a suggestion rather than a rule.
