/**
 * What a co-signer lets a counterparty's commitment do to the group's money (`docs/group-lightning-wallet.md`,
 * Phase 9, check 5). Pure: the ledger it reads and returns is the caller's to store.
 *
 * In the counterparty's commitment `toRemote` is ours, and an HTLC *they* receive is one *we* offered.
 * What the group can claim from a commitment is [value]: our balance plus what we have offered and not yet
 * lost, because an offered HTLC comes back if it fails. Everything else is the counterparty's.
 *
 * The rules, in order:
 *
 * 1. **The commitment number moves forward by one**, or repeats with the same transaction (a
 *    retransmission after a reconnect).
 * 2. **A new HTLC we offer is a payment the group authorised**: its hash has an authorisation with budget
 *    left for it. Refusing here is the only refusal that works -- once the counterparty has the preimage,
 *    a commitment we do not sign does not stop it claiming on chain.
 * 3. **The value never falls below the floor.** The floor starts at the value of the channel's first
 *    commitment less the fee allowance, rises by what the group receives, and falls by what an authorised
 *    payment spends. A fall in value is explained by an authorised HTLC we offered disappearing without
 *    coming back, which consumes its budget; any other fall eats the fee allowance, and when that is gone
 *    the co-signer stops signing.
