/**
 * A group's wallet on chain: the counterpart of Phoenix's `FinalWallet`, watching
 * the addresses [account] derives.
 *
 * Phoenix's final wallet watches one address forever. A group hands addresses out
 * from several devices and keeps change, so this watches both BIP44 branches, each
 * gap-limited -- and because an `ElectrumMiniWallet` holds one address generator,
 * that is two of them. Both share the identity's Electrum client, which is safe:
 * each ignores script hashes it does not know.
 *
 * In memory, as Phoenix's is. Everything it knows is fetched again from Electrum
 * when it starts, and nothing about the wallet is stored -- the addresses are a
 * derivation, and the coins are on chain.
