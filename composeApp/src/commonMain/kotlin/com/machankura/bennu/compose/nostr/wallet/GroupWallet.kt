         * statement from moving every address of one already holding coins:
         *

         *     stays guarded, whatever a client that predates guardians signs later;
         *  2. among guarded ones the earliest decides the guardians, and a later one
         *     naming others is ignored. Changing who guards a wallet is another
         *     account.
         *
         * And before either, a statement [policy] does not allow is no wallet at
         * all -- `docs/subgroup-wallet-policy.md`. Under a parent that decided
         * *guarded* a plain statement is ignored even with no guarded one beside
         * it, which is stronger than rule 1: an older client's plain wallet then
         * opens nothing on this device, no addresses derived and no coins
         * watched, rather than a wallet the rest of the group refuses to spend.
