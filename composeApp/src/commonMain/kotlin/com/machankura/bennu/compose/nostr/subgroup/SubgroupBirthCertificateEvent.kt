/**
 * A group saying, with a quorum, that another group is its child.
 *
 * The whole of what a subgroup relationship is. A child has its own ChillDKG
 * key, its own room, its own quorum and its own admins -- nothing is inherited
 * and nothing is delegated -- and this is the one thing that ties it to a
 * parent:
 *
 * > The group holding key `P` said, with a quorum, that the room `C` is its
 * > child.
 *
 * Produced by a `FrostSigningEvents.PROPOSAL` in the **parent's** room, so the
 * author is the parent room's id and no single member can make one. It then
 * travels, whole, on the child's `GroupKeyStateEvent` -- see
 * `GroupKeyStateManager.stateFrom`, which is where a state carrying one earns
 * its parentage or is dropped.
 *
 * ```
 *  ceremony among the child's admins  -> threshold key K, and so C = marmotGroupId(K)
 *  coordinator --[ 30320 over a 30329 ]-> the parent's room
 *  ...the parent's quorum signs...
 *  every parent device holds the certificate     "C is ours"
 *  coordinator --[ 30320 over a 30326 ]-> the child's ceremony room, carrying it
 * ```
 *
 * ### Content is the id; the tags are what make it checkable
 *
 * Taken literally a birth certificate is 32 opaque bytes, and a parent admin
 * would be asked to sign a number they cannot check, produced by a ceremony most
 * of them were not in, on behalf of people they have only the coordinator's word
 * about. So [assembleTags] carries the child's threshold key, the derivation
 * path, its founding admins and its name. The signature covers all of it -- an
 * event id hashes over its tags -- so nothing is added to the claim by putting
 * it there, only to what a signer can see before agreeing.
 *
 * The one that earns its place is [SubgroupKeyTag]: with it a signer's device
 * can check `marmotGroupId(key, path) == content` for itself, which is the
 * difference between approving a hash and approving a group.
 *
 * ### Guardian keys
 *
 * A certificate may also carry [GuardianTag]s: the parent's own guardian key for
 * this child, and behind it every key the parent's ancestors granted the parent,
 * each one public step further -- `GuardianDerivation.grant`. Carrying them is
 * the parent agreeing to guard the child's wallet, if the child ever opens a
 * guarded one; it delegates nothing on its own. They are not among the checks in
 * [certifies], which is about lineage. Whether they are the keys the parent
 * grants is checked by every parent signer before the certificate is signed --
 * `SubgroupManager.refuseCertificate` -- and nowhere after, because nobody else holds
 * the key that check needs and nobody else needs it: the parent's quorum can
 * already spend through its own leaf whatever the others would let it.
 *
 * ### The wallet policy
 *
 * A certificate may carry a [WalletPolicyTag]: the parent deciding whether the
 * child's wallet is guarded or unguarded, rather than leaving it to the child --
 * `docs/subgroup-wallet-policy.md`. A guarded certificate carries the guardian
 * keys and an unguarded one carries none, and [parseWalletPolicy] refuses one
 * whose policy and keys disagree. Like the keys, the policy is not among the
 * checks in [certifies]: it is read where it is used.
 *
 * ### What [certifies] deliberately does not check
 *
 * The name and the `p` tags are the **founding** roster. A certificate is signed
 * once; members join and leave and rooms get renamed afterwards, and none of
 * that reaches a signature already made. Comparing either against a room's
 * current state would start rejecting a valid certificate the first time
 * somebody joined the child, and the rejection would look exactly like a
 * forgery. They are shown as history and are never a live roster.
 *
 * ### Replaceable, by this app rather than by a relay
 *
 * Like every kind in this family it only ever exists inside an encryption a
 * relay cannot open, so the addressable semantics of the 3xxxx range never fire.
 * [DTag] is the child's room id and the newest certificate per child wins, which
 * the local store settles on its own. That matters in practice: two parent
 * admins can propose a certificate for the same child at once, and two true
 * statements about one child should fold together rather than accumulate.
