 * number to change if the app ever takes a font whose average advance is visibly wider or
 * narrower than the system stack's, and changing it moves the measure on every screen at

/**
 * Holds this element to a readable measure and centres it in whatever space it is given.
 *
 * The one change that decides whether a screen written for a phone survives a 1800dp
 * window. Without it a paragraph runs the full width and becomes unreadable -- the eye
 * loses the start of the next line -- and a form's fields stretch to 1700dp for a
 * six-character input. With it the content keeps the proportions it was designed at and
 * the window's extra width becomes margin, which is what M3's single-pane canonical
 * layout does.
 *
 * The centring is of the *column*, not of the text inside it. Those are opposite things:
 * a centred column still has a straight leading edge for every row, avatar and icon to
 * align to, which is what the grids-and-spacing page asks for. Centred text has none.
 *
 * Applied at the top of a `Scaffold`'s content, so a screen gets it once:
 *
 *     Scaffold(...) { innerPadding ->
 *         Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding).readableContent()) { … }
 *     }
 *
 * A no-op on any window narrower than the measure, which is every phone.
