/**
 * The Electrum connection each network's group wallets watch through, for one identity.
 *
 * The identity has one for the network its node runs on -- the node's own, or for a profile with no
 * node the one `IdentityElectrum` gives it -- and every wallet on that network shares it. A group may
 * keep a wallet on another network as well -- testnet3, while its Lightning wallet is tried there
 * (`docs/group-lightning-wallet.md`, Phase 4) -- and that network gets a [StandaloneElectrum] of its
 * own, made the first time a wallet on it asks and kept for the identity's life, for the reason
 * [GroupOnchainWallets] keeps its wallets: a subscription is cheap and the first answer slow. Being the
 * same loop as the identity's own, it follows the profile's Tor setting.
