 * device is the one the wallet will belong to. The other generates a bare key and
 * writes a credential -- for the switcher, where a user who wants another profile has
 * not asked for another Lightning node, another set of channels, or a second phrase
 * with funds behind it. Under docs/multiple-profiles.md the two differ by exactly one
 * thing, whether a wallet is attached to the profile they make, which is what the model
