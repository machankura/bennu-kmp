 * One thing a ChillDKG ritual needs this device's owner to agree to before it

 * The ritual is driven by arriving messages, so without these it runs to
 * completion on its own — a relay delivering an event to a phone in a pocket is
 * enough to enrol its owner in a group's permanent signing quorum. Each step is a
 * separate decision because each publishes something different and commits the
 * member to something different, and each is presented on its own screen.
 *
 * The coordinator's two aggregations are deliberately not here. They relay other
 * members' already-published messages and disclose nothing of the coordinator's
 * own, so gating them would stall the whole group on one person's attention
 * without protecting anybody.
