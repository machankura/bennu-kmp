/**
 * The parent's signed birth certificate, carried whole on the child's key state.
 *
 * A whole event inside a tag value, which wants justifying. The alternative is a
 * bare 64-byte signature plus a rule for rebuilding the event it covers -- kind,
 * author, tags, `created_at` -- from fields carried alongside. That rule breaks
 * silently the first time the certificate's shape changes: a rebuild differing by
 * one byte hashes to an id whose signature does not verify, and is
 * indistinguishable from a forgery. Every state signed before the change would
 * stop being believed, all at once, for a reason nothing logs.
 *
 * A few hundred bytes inside an encryption removes that class entirely. The
 * event travels as the parent signed it and is checked as the parent signed it.
 *
 * Nothing here says the certificate is *good*. Parsing is JSON and nothing else;
 * whether the parent really signed it, and really signed it for this child, is
 * `SubgroupBirthCertificateEvent.certifies` -- see `GroupKeyStateManager.stateFrom`,
 * which drops the whole state when it says no.
