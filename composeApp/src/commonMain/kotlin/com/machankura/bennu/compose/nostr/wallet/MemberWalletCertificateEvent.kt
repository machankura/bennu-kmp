/**
 * A group saying it guards a wallet for one of its members: the group's
 * signature over the member's request, and what every device opens the wallet
 * on.
 *
 * ```
 *  member      --[ 30335 request, signed by them ]-> the group's room
 *  any signer  --[ 30320 proposal over a 30334   ]-> the group's room
 *  ...a signing session...
 *  everyone holds the signed 30334                   "this group guards W for this person"
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * kind:       30334
 * pubkey:     G                         set by the signing session
 * created_at: the request's created_at  so every sponsor proposes one event id
 * content:    W
 * tags:
 *   ["d",          W]
 *   ["p",          <the member's npub>]
 *   ["wallet_key", <P_W>]
 *   ["chain",      …]
 *   ["guardian",   …]                   as in the request
 *   ["descriptor", …, "receive"]
 *   ["descriptor", …, "change"]
 *   ["label",      …]                   if the request had one
 *   ["request",    <the signed 30335, whole>]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Not a birth certificate
 *
 * A `SubgroupBirthCertificateEvent` says *this room is my child*, and every
 * reader of 30329 assumes a room -- its `certifies` rederives one from the key,
 * `SubgroupManager.subgroupsOf` lists one, the transcript announces one being
 * born. A member's wallet is not a room, so it has its own kind and none of the
 * lineage meaning. `docs/member-guarded-wallets.md`, "Should it be a birth
 * certificate?".
 *
 * ### Built from the request and nothing else
 *
 * [template] is the only way a certificate is made, and [verify] checks one is
 * exactly [template] of the request it carries. So the sponsor who puts a
 * request to the group chooses nothing, two sponsors propose one event id, and
 * no tag can say one thing in the request and another in the certificate.
 *
 * The request is embedded rather than looked up, as a guarded statement embeds
 * its birth certificate: an ancestor who was never in the group's room can
 * check that the member asked, from the group's signature alone.
 *
 * ### Never on a relay
 *
 * It carries an xpub.
 *
 * ### Why 30334
 *
 * The first free number past the guarded-wallet notice (30333), which carries
 * it upward to the groups above.
