/**
 * Sends the group's signed transactions to the network, and watches for them.
 *
 * Every member with an Electrum client broadcasts. The transaction is identical
 * on every device, so a second broadcast is nothing to the network, and nobody's
 * phone being asleep holds up the group -- unlike a group event, whose sending is
 * a separate decision, the quorum has already decided the one thing broadcasting
 * does.
 *
 * Electrum's broadcast reports success whatever the server said, so a broadcast
 * is recorded when it was sent and nothing more; [GroupTransaction.seenAt] is
 * written only when Electrum reports the transaction back, and an unseen one is
 * sent again every [REBROADCAST_AFTER], which is what `IElectrumClient` asks of
 * its callers. A confirmation goes through [FrostSigningManager.recordConfirmed],
 * which settles every other spend of the same coins.
 *
 * A spend Electrum has not heard of may have lost its coins. Only the group can
 * spend a plain wallet's coins, so there the loser is always another of the
 * room's own spends and the winner's confirmation settles it. A guarded wallet's
 * coins have a second spender, in another room: so an unseen spend asks the
 * chain whether its coins are still there, and one taken by a *confirmed*
 * transaction it is not goes through [FrostSigningManager.recordReplaced]. A
 * conflict still in the mempool settles nothing -- ours may yet be the one that
 * confirms.
