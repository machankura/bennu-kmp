/**
 * What has to be written once a queued inner event has been encrypted into a
 * group event: where it is sent, and which transcript row -- if any -- the send
 * belongs to.
 *
 * The two are independent, and this exists to say so. A group event is sent
 * because it was queued; a chat line is linked because a member said something.
 * Letting the second decide the first is what silenced FROST signing: the
 * broadcast rows were written inside `chatMessageOrNull?.let { }`, and protocol
 * traffic has no ChatMessage -- `ChatMessage.applyInnerEvent` returns null for
 * every [com.machankura.bennu.compose.nostr.frost.FrostSigningEvents] kind and for
 * [com.machankura.bennu.compose.nostr.frost.GroupKeyStateEvent], and
 * `FrostSigningManager` queues its messages without one. So every signing
 * proposal was MLS-encrypted, wrapped, persisted and marked processed, and then
 * never sent to a relay. Nothing failed; the other participants simply never saw
 * it.
 *
 * Pulled out of `MarmotOutboundDao.encryptAndSendMarmotInnerEvent` because that
 * function is Room-backed and cannot be unit tested, which is precisely how the
 * gate survived. The decision is separated from the filing of it for the same
 * reason [MarmotDirectMessage.classify] is.
