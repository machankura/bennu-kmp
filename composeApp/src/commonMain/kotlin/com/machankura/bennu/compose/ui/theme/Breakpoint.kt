/**
 * M3's five window width breakpoints.
 *
 * Renamed from "window size class" in the May 2026 revision, which also grew the set from
 * three to five: [Large] and [ExtraLarge] were split off the old expanded class because a
 * 1600dp window and an 850dp one want different numbers of panes. Values are from
 * m3.material.io/foundations/layout/applying-layout/window-size-classes, read September
 * 2026.
 *
 * | breakpoint   | width       | panes                  | navigation              |
 * |--------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
 * | [Compact]    | under 600dp | 1                      | navigation bar          |
 * | [Medium]     | 600–839dp   | 1 recommended          | collapsed rail          |
 * | [Expanded]   | 840–1199dp  | 2 recommended          | collapsed/expanded rail |
 * | [Large]      | 1200–1599dp | 2 recommended          | expanded rail           |
 * | [ExtraLarge] | 1600dp+     | up to 3                | expanded rail           |
 *
 * The classification is on the **window**, not on the composable being measured. That is
 * the distinction between this and `BoxWithConstraints`: a pane 300dp wide inside a
 * 1400dp window is still in a large layout, and should not start behaving like a phone.
 * Anything wanting the local constraints should still measure them.
 *
 * @property minWidth the narrowest window that falls in this breakpoint.

 * future splash -- have nowhere else to get it.
 *
 * **Why the window size and not `currentWindowAdaptiveInfo()`.** The latter also computes
 * a [androidx.compose.material3.adaptive.Posture] from the platform's fold state, which
 * on android means reaching for `WindowInfoTracker` and an `Activity`. This is called
 * from [BennuTheme], which wraps every `@Preview` in the tree, and a preview context is
 * not an activity. `currentWindowDpSize()` is `LocalWindowInfo` and `LocalDensity` and
 * nothing else, so it answers everywhere. The pane scaffolds ask for posture themselves,
 * where a fold genuinely changes the answer.
