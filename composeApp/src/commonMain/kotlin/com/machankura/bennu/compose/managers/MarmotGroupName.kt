/**
 * What a Marmot room is called: a `#`, then the name.
 *
 * A device's room list holds two unrelated kinds of room. A NIP-17 room is a
 * conversation between the people in it; a Marmot room is a *group* -- it has an
 * id its key derives, a membership baked into an MLS tree, admins who can act for
 * it, and a signature anyone can check. Nothing on a row says which one is which,
 * and the two behave differently enough that guessing is a mistake. The `#` says
 * it, in the one place a user always reads.
 *
 * This replaces naming a group's Marmot room `"Ekklesia (#admins)"`. That form
 * said the same thing in more words and only for the *admin* room -- a subgroup
 * got no marker at all, so half the Marmot rooms on a device were unmarked, and
 * "Ekklesia (#admins)" sorted nowhere near "Ekklesia". `#Ekklesia` marks both
 * kinds, and marks them at the front where a truncated row still shows it.
 *
 * Applied where a Marmot room is minted rather than where it is drawn, because
 * the name is baked into the epoch-0 `MarmotGroupData` every member is welcomed
 * with: a name that only existed at the point of display would be a name this
 * device alone could see.
