/**
 * A kind:1 the group signed: something it said publicly, as itself.
 *
 * The room's id is the pubkey it signs as, so a note authored by that key is the
 * *group* posting rather than a member posting in the group. Those are different
 * things and the room already has the second one -- the transcript. This is the
 * first: a statement the group put a quorum's signature to, which any reader can
 * check came from the group and not from whoever typed it.
 *
 * ### Why this is not a `Post` row
 *
 * `Post` hangs off both `NostrEvent` and `Profile` by foreign key, and a group has
 * neither: a group-signed event is not a `NostrEvent` -- see `GroupNostrProfile`,
 * which gives the reasoning at length -- and the group has no `Profile` row for the
 * same reason. So a group's posts live where the group's other signed statements
 * live, and this is the reading of them.
 *
 * ### Nothing here has reached a relay
 *
 * The same caveat `GroupNostrProfile` and `GroupRelayList` carry, and it bites
 * hardest here: a post is the one kind of statement whose entire purpose is to be
 * read by people outside the group. `FrostSigningManager.complete` applies signed
 * events locally and puts nothing on the wire, so for now a group's posts are
 * visible to its members and to nobody else. The relay lists beside them say where
 * they should go; sending them is a job that does not exist yet.
