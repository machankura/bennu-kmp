/**
 * A member telling an ancestor group about a descendant's guarded wallet.
 *
 * The descendant's quorum signed a guarded `GroupWalletStatementEvent` in its
 * own room, and the ancestors whose keys are in it are not in that room. A
 * member who sits in both carries the statement across, whole, as the content of
 * one of these in the ancestor's MLS room:
 *
 * ```
 *  descendant's room   every member holds the signed 30331     "we keep a guarded wallet"
 *  member in both --[ 30333 carrying it ]-> the ancestor's room
 *  every ancestor device checks it on its own, and watches the wallet
 * ```
 *
 * The forwarder vouches for nothing. A device believes the statement inside for
 * the same reasons a descendant member does -- the descendant's room signed it,
 * a certificate it carries certifies that room, the xpub rederives from the key
 * the certificate names -- plus one of its own: its own guardian key in the
 * statement is the key its group's walk reaches. See `GuardianManager.verify`.
 *
 * No table: the row the inbound path files for every inner event is the record,
 * and each read checks it again.
 *
 * ### The guardian's birth certificate
 *
 * A notice carrying a member's wallet certificate (30334) also carries, where
 * the forwarder holds it, the birth certificate of the group that signed it --
 * the 30329 its own parent signed:
 *
 * ```
 * kind:    30333
 * content: <the 30334, whole>
 * tags:
 *   ["h",           <the room told>]
 *   ["certificate", <the 30329 that certifies the wallet's nearest guardian, whole>]
 * ```
 *
 * It is what lets a device in a group above, never in the guarding group's
 * room, show the wallet under that group's founding name. It is a tag so an
 * older build, which reads the content and nothing else, still believes the
 * wallet; and it is checked rather than trusted, as everything here is -- a
 * certificate that does not certify that group is ignored, and the wallet is
 * believed all the same. `docs/member-wallet-guarding-group.md`, D4.
 *
 * ### Never on a relay
 *
 * The statement inside is an xpub, which is every address and the whole
 * balance. Like the statement, this only ever lives inside an encryption a relay
 * cannot open: it is an MLS application message and nothing else.
 *
 * ### Why 30333
 *
 * The first free number past the transaction proposal (30332), beside the
 * statement it carries.
