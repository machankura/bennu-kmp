/**
 * 30327
 *
 * A page of the group's signed record, sent to a member who does not have it.
 *
 * A member added after the work was done sees none of it and never will. MLS
 * gives them no history -- correctly, that is forward secrecy -- but the sharper
 * problem is that group-signed events never travel at all: `FrostSigningManager`
 * applies a finished signature locally on every device that took part, because
 * the outbound pipeline would re-author a rumor as its sender and strip the
 * group's signature off. A member who was not in the session has nothing to
 * derive the event from, and no later message carries it. This is that path.
 *
 * Each payload travels whole, keeping its own id, author and signature, so the
 * receiver checks it rather than believing it -- see [isSignedByRoom] on
 * `GroupKeyStateEvent`. The sender of a chronicle is therefore not trusted, which
 * is what lets any member answer.
 *
 * See docs/member-chronicle.md for the whole design, including the two things this
 * deliberately does not do: it never carries the chat, and it cannot make its
 * recipient able to *sign* anything.
 *
 * It carries nothing in this app at the moment -- see [KINDS].
