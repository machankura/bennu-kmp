 * One transaction a member signed alone from their guarded wallet.

 * `GroupTransaction` cannot hold it: its foreign keys are to a session and a
 * room, and a member's own spend has neither. Written whole when it is signed,
 * then filled in as the chain answers.
 *
 * No foreign key to [MemberWallet] either. A spend is a fact about the chain,
 * and a row that cascaded away with its wallet would take the record of where
 * the coins went with it.
