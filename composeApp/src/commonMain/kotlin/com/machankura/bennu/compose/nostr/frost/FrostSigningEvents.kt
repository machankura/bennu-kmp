/**
 * The nostr kinds a FROST signing session is carried on.
 *
 * These are **rumor** kinds: they only ever exist inside an encryption a relay
 * cannot open, so no relay sees them and the replaceable semantics normally
 * implied by the 3xxxx range never apply. Almost always that is a Marmot group
 * event -- MLS-encrypted to the group and then wrapped again under the group's
 * exporter secret. The exception is a group's first session, which agrees what
 * its admin room will sign with *before* that room exists and so runs in the
 * NIP-17 room its ceremony ran in, on gift wraps. See
 * `GroupKeyStateManager.propose`.
 *
 * Who talks to whom, in order:
 *
 * ```
 *  proposer --[ 30320 proposal   ]-> everyone   the unsigned event to sign
 *  signer   --[ 30321 nonce      ]-> everyone   this device's public nonce
 *  proposer --[ 30322 signer set ]-> everyone   who is signing, and their aggregated nonce
 *  signer   --[ 30323 partial    ]-> everyone   this device's partial signature
 *  proposer --[ 30324 signature  ]-> everyone   the finished 64-byte signature
 *  anyone   --[ 30325 failure    ]-> everyone   abandon + blame
 *  signer   --[ 30330 decline    ]-> everyone   this member will not sign
 * ```
 *
 * A decline is not a failure, which is why it is a kind of its own. A t-of-n
 * key needs t willing members, not n, so one member saying no leaves the
 * session open for the rest -- and every device counts the refusals it has
 * seen against the same arithmetic, abandoning only once fewer than t members
 * could still sign. See `FrostSigningManager.recordDecline`. A failure is the
 * other thing: a fault that no quorum can work around, and it ends the session
 * wherever it lands.
 *
 * [GroupKeyStateEvent] sits just past the first six on 30326. It is not part of
 * a session -- it is the standing fact a session is opened against, saying which
 * key the room signs with -- so it is deliberately outside [ALL], which is what
 * the inbound path dispatches a session message on. 30327-30329 went to the
 * chronicle and subgroup families before a session needed a seventh kind, which
 * is why the decline sits at 30330 rather than in the run.
 *
 * ### Why 3032x
 *
 * These share the inner-event space with the nip30303 document kinds, which run
 * 30300 up to [com.machankura.bennu.compose.nostr.nip30303.SubmissionEvent] at 30312 --
 * the same space, because both are Marmot inner events and both are dispatched
 * on kind by the same inbound path. Starting at 30320 leaves that family room to
 * grow into.
 *
 * The DKG's 30310-30316 *did* clash with that family, once a subgroup's ceremony
 * moved into its parent's Marmot room: its proposal, host key and round 1 sat on
 * 30310-30312 beside three nip30303 kinds, in the same inner-event space, and
 * round 1 reached the parent's chat as an unreadable submission. They were told
 * apart only by NIP-17 gift wraps carrying one and Marmot the other, which was
 * an accident of routing rather than a decision. `ChatMessage` now recognises
 * this family's kinds and the DKG's before any content kind, which is the
 * decision. A new family should still take numbers nobody else uses -- see
 * docs/ceremony-creation.md.
