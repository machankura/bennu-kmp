/**
 * Takes an identity off the device: the credential out of the file, its preference
 * files deleted, its metadata hidden, its account rows gone -- in that order, so a
 * failure partway leaves the credential on disk rather than an identity the selector
 * lists but nothing can open. The caller then re-lists and clears the active identity.
 *
 * Lifted out of `NostrSecretViewModel.forgetKey`, where it was written for an nsec, so
 * that the two exits a read-only identity has -- sign out, and *use a different key* on
 * the not-found screen -- run the same sequence rather than a copy of it. The first step
 * is the same call for both credential kinds since the credentials file; only a profile
 * with a wallet attached is refused, because removing a seed is a wallet question this
 * does not answer, and because the seed would derive the key again.
 *
 * The two writers are injected as functions so the sequence can be pinned in a test
 * without a key store, as the nsec view model's already is.
