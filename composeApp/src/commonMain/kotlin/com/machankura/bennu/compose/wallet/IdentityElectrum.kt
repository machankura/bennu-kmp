/**
 * The Electrum client the active identity watches the chain on.
 *
 * A profile with a node watches on the node's client; one with no node -- an nsec
 * or an npub -- gets a [StandaloneElectrum] of its own. Never both: a second
 * connection from a profile that has one would tell a second server the same
 * addresses, and give the wallets a chain that can disagree with the node's (D1 of
 * `docs/standalone-electrum.md`). The test is the node client, not the kind, as
 * `switchToIdentity` tests `business`.
 *
 * One per app, held by the nav host. A change of identity stops the last
 * standalone client *before* the next is made, so a switch between two nsec
 * profiles never has two connections open; a stopped client cannot be restarted,
 * so the next is always new.
