/**
 * The seed a group Lightning wallet's node runs from, as this device received or made it
 * (`docs/group-lightning-wallet.md`, decision D4 and Phase 6).
 *
 * Every Iceberg participant holds it, so that a handover keeps the channels and a lost operator phone
 * does not lose them. It is keyed by the node id it produces, which this device computed itself on
 * receipt: two members proposing a wallet at once each send a seed, and the statement the group signs
 * names the node, which picks between them.
 *
 * Plaintext, like the shares beside it, and with the same cost stated where the wallet is opened.
