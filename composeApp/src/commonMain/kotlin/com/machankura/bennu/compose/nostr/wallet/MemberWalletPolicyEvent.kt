/**
 * A group saying, with a quorum, whether it guards its members' wallets and at
 * what delay -- `docs/member-wallet-delay.md`.
 *
 * ```
 * open:    ["d", "member-wallets"], ["guardian_delay", "<blocks>"]
 * closed:  ["d", "member-wallets"], ["closed"]
 * ```
 *
 * Signed by the group's own quorum in its own room, about its own leaf: the
 * delay on the group's leaf in every wallet a member asks it to guard from now
 * on. Every group above keeps the delay it chose for the group, as it does in a
 * subgroup's wallet.
 *
 * ### The group's opt-in
 *
 * No policy means the group does not guard members' wallets. A closed one means
 * it has stopped: no new member wallets until a newer open one. Closing never
 * releases a wallet already guarded -- the group's leaf is in every one of its
 * addresses -- and a later policy never changes one, since each wallet's delay
 * is fixed in its certificate.
 *
 * ### Not the birth certificate
 *
 * The certificate is the parent's statement about the group, signed once at its
 * birth, and a root group has none. This is the group's decision about its own
 * leaf, which the group can change. See the note's *Where the delay should live*.
 *
 * ### Why 30337
 *
 * After the key notice (30336), the last of the member-wallet kinds.
