/**
 * Reads a backlog of group events again, repeatedly, until repeating stops helping.
 *
 * The whole reason a replay is worth anything is that the events depend on each
 * other: a commit nobody could apply is what a room's later messages were waiting
 * on, and applying it makes them readable. So one pass in order is not enough --
 * a pass that recovers something has changed what the next pass can do.
 *
 * Ordering is the caller's business; this only decides how many times to go round.
 * A pass that recovers nothing ends it, because everything left is waiting on
 * something no later pass will produce either.
 *
 * Kept apart from the database so the stopping rule can be read, and tested, on
 * its own -- it is the part with something to get wrong.
