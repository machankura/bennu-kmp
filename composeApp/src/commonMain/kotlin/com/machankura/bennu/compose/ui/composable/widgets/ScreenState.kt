/**
 * The two states every list and every screen has, and neither of which had a home.
 *
 * Before this file the tree held **16 copies** of
 *
 *     Column(horizontalAlignment = CenterHorizontally) {
 *         Spacer(Modifier.height(48.dp))
 *         Text("Something went wrong")
 *     }
 *
 * and five of the same shape saying "No events were found". Not one of the sixteen offered
 * a retry, so every failure in this app was a dead end: the message named no cause, and
 * the only way out was the back button.
 *
 * M3's content guidance asks the opposite -- "emphasize the results of the user's
 * potential action", "tell users what will happen ... and how they can undo it" -- and its
 * structure guidance asks that a screen say what to do next rather than only what
 * happened.
 *
 * These two composables are deliberately plain: an icon, a line, and for [ErrorState] an
 * action when the caller can offer one. They are the thing 21 call sites collapse into,
 * not a design in their own right.

/**
 * Fades between a screen's states instead of cutting.
 *
 * Every screen in this app is a `when` over a UI state -- loading, error, empty, loaded --
 * and every one of those transitions was an unannounced cut: the spinner is there in one
 * frame and the content is there in the next, with nothing saying they are the same screen
 * answering the same question.
 *
 * M3's fade-through, which is the transition for content that replaces other content
 * without being spatially related to it: the outgoing state fades out, the incoming one
 * fades in and grows the last few percent into place. `SizeTransform` is off, so a tall
 * loaded state does not stretch a short spinner on its way in.
 *
 * **The content key is the state's class, not the state.** Without it a screen would
 * re-run the whole transition every time its loaded data changed -- a message arriving, a
 * list growing -- which is a fade over content that did not change state at all. With it,
 * the animation runs when the state does and the data flows through untouched.
 *
 * **`AnimatedContent` is a layout node**, so it must wrap a `when` that is a composable's
 * whole body. Where the `when` sits inside a `Column` whose branches use
 * `Modifier.weight`, wrapping it would take the branches out of `ColumnScope`; those
 * screens are left alone and the reason is here rather than repeated at each of them.
 *
 * @param state the screen's current UI state.
 * @param label named for the animation inspector; the screen's own name is the useful one.
