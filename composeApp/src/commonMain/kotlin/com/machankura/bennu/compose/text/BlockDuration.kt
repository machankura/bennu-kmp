/**
 * A number of blocks said in time, roughly -- `docs/guardian-delay.md`, D5.
 *
 * Always beside the block count, never instead of it: blocks are what a
 * guardian's leaf counts, and ten minutes is the target, not a promise, so a
 * delay of 144 blocks can take twenty hours or thirty. Hence *about*.
 *
 * The rule:
 *
 *  1. within 5% of exactly one hour, day, month or year, that unit, singular --
 *     6 blocks is *about 1 hour*, 4,320 *about 1 month*;
 *  2. otherwise the largest of years, months, days, hours and minutes in which
 *     the delay comes to at least 2, rounded -- 216 blocks is *about 36 hours*,
 *     65,535 *about 15 months*.
 *
 * Years therefore appear only near exactly one year: the longest delay a leaf
 * can carry is 1.25 years, and *about 15 months* says more than *about 1 year*.
