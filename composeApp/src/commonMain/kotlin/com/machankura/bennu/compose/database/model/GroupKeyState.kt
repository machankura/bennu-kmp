/**
 * Which shared key a room signs with, as the group itself has said.
 *
 * Written from a `GroupKeyStateEvent` -- the room's own statement of the
 * ceremony behind it, signed by the group's threshold key -- and read when a
 * signing request arrives, to pick the secret share out of the right
 * [DkgSession]. A device that took part in more than one ceremony holds more
 * than one share, and they are not interchangeable: a partial signature made
 * with the wrong one cannot aggregate.
 *
 * The row appears as the room does. The group agrees the state before the room
 * exists -- in the NIP-17 room its ceremony ran in -- and every device that took
 * part files it the moment it has a room to file it against, whether it created
 * the room or was handed it by a Welcome. See `GroupKeyStateManager.adopt`.
 *
 * A device that was not in the ceremony holds no state and signing resolves its
 * key by rederiving, which is what every room did before this table existed.
 *
 * ### Why this is a row and not a rederivation
 *
 * `FrostSigningManager.completedKey` found the key by walking every ceremony
 * this device holds a share for and rederiving each one's room id until one
 * matched. That works, and it stays as the fallback for rooms made before this
 * table existed, but it can only find rooms derived at the *default* path --
 * the one path the constant names. A room derived anywhere else was invisible
 * to it. [derivationPath] is what fixes that, which is also the reason the path
 * is stored rather than assumed.
 *
 * ### Nothing secret lives here
 *
 * [thresholdPublicKey] is the key signatures verify against, not the secret
 * behind it, and [dkgSessionId] is a pointer. The share itself never leaves
 * `DkgSession.secretShare` on the device that generated it.
 *
 * One row per room: a room is derived from one key, and a group that re-runs
 * its ceremony derives a different room rather than re-keying this one.
