/**
 * A group making another group, and the four steps that take.
 *
 * ```
 *  1. ChillDKG among the child's admins  -> threshold key K, and so C = marmotGroupId(K)
 *  2. birth certificate, in the parent   -> the parent's quorum signs C
 *  3. key state, among the child's admins -> the child's quorum signs "C signs with K", carrying it
 *  4. the Marmot room                    -> somebody creates C and welcomes the admins
 * ```
 *
 * **All four happen in the parent's room**, bar the last, which makes a room of
 * its own. Steps 1 and 3 are held there because the child has nowhere else to be:
 * its id is derived from the key step 1 produces, so it cannot exist until
 * afterwards. Step 2 is there because the signature is the parent's.
 *
 * None of that order is a policy choice. Step 2 needs `C`, which does not exist
 * until step 1 produces `K`; step 3 carries the certificate, so it needs step 2;
 * and step 4 is gated on the key state for the same reason
 * `DkgRitualViewModel.createAdminGroup` already is -- a room created before its
 * group has agreed what it signs with is a room whose founding fact is settled
 * after the founding.
 *
 * This orchestrates; it does not reimplement. Step 1 is `ChillDkgRitualManager`,
 * steps 2 and 3 are `FrostSigningManager` sessions, and step 4 is
 * `MarmotGroupCreation`. What lives here is the order, the guards, and the
 * reading of what the parent has signed.
 *
 * ### Only step 1 belongs to the coordinator
 *
 * After the ceremony fixes the participant set, every remaining step is open to
 * somebody else: the certificate to any parent admin holding a share of the
 * parent's key, and the key state and the room to any of the child's admins, who
 * by then all hold shares of `K` and know `C`. A coordinator whose phone dies
 * after the ceremony strands nothing. That is why every function here reads its
 * state off stored rows rather than off a session object handed down from the
 * screen that started.
 *
 * See `docs/subgroups.md`.
