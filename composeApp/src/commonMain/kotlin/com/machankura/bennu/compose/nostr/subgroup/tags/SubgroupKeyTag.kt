/**
 * The subgroup's own ChillDKG threshold public key, 33-byte compressed hex.
 *
 * On a birth certificate this is what makes the thing checkable rather than
 * opaque. Without it a parent admin is asked to put the group's signature to 32
 * bytes produced by a ceremony most of them were not in; with it, their device
 * can walk `SharedKeyDerivation.marmotGroupId(key, path)` and see for itself that
 * the id being certified really is that key's room.
 *
 * Nothing secret is in here. A threshold public key is what signatures verify
 * against, and the shares behind it never leave the devices that generated them.
 *
 * Shape only, and borrowed rather than restated: `GroupKeyStateEvent` already
 * decides what a threshold key looks like off the wire, and two readers of one
 * value that disagreed about its shape would be a bug nobody would find. Whether
 * it is *the* key for the room is settled by rederiving the room from it, not by
 * looking at it.
