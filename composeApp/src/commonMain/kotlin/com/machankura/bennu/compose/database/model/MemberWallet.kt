/**
 * A guarded wallet this device holds the key of: one member's random key, and
 * the request that asked a group to guard it. `docs/member-guarded-wallets.md`.
 *
 * The key is why there is a table at all. Everything else about a member's
 * wallet is read off signed events -- whether it is certified is whether the
 * group's room holds a 30334 for [walletId] that verifies, read again each time
 * the way `GroupWallet` reads statements -- so there is no *certified* column to
 * disagree with the signature.
 *
 * ### `guardingChatRoomId` is a plain column, never a foreign key
 *
 * The argument `docs/subgroups.md` makes against cascading `parentChatRoomId`,
 * with money at the end of it. Deleting the group's room on this device must
 * never delete a private key that coins may sit behind; and a member who leaves
 * the group keeps a wallet the group still guards.
 *
 * ### One database holds every profile
 *
 * So every read is scoped by [ownerPublicKey], the profile the key belongs to.
