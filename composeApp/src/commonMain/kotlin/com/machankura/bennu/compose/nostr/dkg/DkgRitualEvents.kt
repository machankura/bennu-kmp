/**
 * The nostr kinds a ChillDKG ritual is carried on.
 *
 * These are **rumor** kinds: they only ever exist inside a NIP-17 gift wrap
 * addressed to the group, so no relay sees them unencrypted and the replaceable
 * semantics normally implied by the 3xxxx range never apply. They sit next to
 * the app's other private kinds (30300-30309) deliberately — the transport,
 * sealing and broadcast pipeline is the same one chat messages ride.
 *
 * Who talks to whom, in order:
 *
 * ```
 *  coordinator --[ 30310 proposal      ]-> everyone   "let's make a t-of-n key"
 *  participant --[ 30311 host key      ]-> everyone   host pubkey for the participant set
 *  participant --[ 30312 round 1       ]-> everyone   pmsg1
 *  coordinator --[ 30313 coord round 1 ]-> everyone   cmsg1
 *  participant --[ 30314 round 2       ]-> everyone   CertEq signature
 *  coordinator --[ 30315 certificate   ]-> everyone   cmsg2, the success certificate
 *  anyone      --[ 30316 failure       ]-> everyone   abort + blame
 * ```
 *
 * Everything is addressed to the whole group rather than point-to-point even
 * where the protocol only needs the coordinator to read it. NIP-17 wraps per
 * recipient anyway, the coordinator is untrusted by construction, and letting
 * every member watch the ritual is what makes the progress UI possible without
 * a second channel.
