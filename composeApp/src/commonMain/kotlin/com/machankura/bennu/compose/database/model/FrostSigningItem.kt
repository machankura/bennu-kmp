/**
 * One event a signing session signs, and everything about it that cannot be
 * shared with the others.
 *
 * A session signs a *batch*: one ceremony, one signer set, one approval, and `n`
 * events. What separates them is forced by FROST rather than chosen. A Schnorr
 * partial signature is `s = k + e·x` with `e = H(R‖P‖m)`, so two messages under
 * one nonce `R` give two equations in one unknown and the secret share falls
 * out. Every item therefore carries its own nonce material and its own result,
 * and the only things a batch may hold in common are the ones that do not enter
 * that equation -- see [FrostSigningSession].
 *
 * These five columns lived on [FrostSigningSession] until the schema moved to
 * v10, which is why a session created before it reads back as exactly one item
 * at [itemIndex] 0.
