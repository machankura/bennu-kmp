     * any check on who sent it, unlike a refusal; `FrostSigningManager`'s

     * it describes -- saying the group has what it needs while the coordinator
     * is still waiting -- which is the one direction a progress figure must
     * never be wrong in. `HOST_KEY` is the message that makes somebody a share
     * holder, and the entity's primary key makes it at most one row per member,
     * so the join cannot multiply a count either.
