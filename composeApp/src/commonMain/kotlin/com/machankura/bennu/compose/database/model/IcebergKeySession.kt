/**
 * One Iceberg key ceremony, as this device took part in it: the key a group's Lightning wallet signs
 * its channels with (`docs/group-lightning-wallet.md`, Phase 5).
 *
 * Like [DkgSession] it stores the ceremony's *inputs* -- the random root this device's contributions
 * come from, and every message received in [IcebergParticipantMessage] -- rather than its state, so
 * every step can be recomputed after a restart.
 *
 * [share] is the member's Iceberg share, plaintext, which is the same decision the onchain wallet
 * made for ChillDKG shares (`docs/group-chain-wallet.md`, Phase 0) and the same cost: a stolen phone
 * plus `t - 1` colluders signs.
