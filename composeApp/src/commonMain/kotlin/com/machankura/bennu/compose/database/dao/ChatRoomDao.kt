/**
 * The chat-list queries carry the room's newest line with them.
 *
 * A correlated subquery rather than a `GROUP BY chatRoomId` with `MAX(createdAt)`: an
 * [com.machankura.bennu.compose.database.model.ChatMessage] timestamp is stored to the second,
 * so a burst of ritual lines written in the same second ties, and the aggregate would
 * pick one of them arbitrarily. Falling back to `id DESC` breaks the tie on the order
 * the rows were actually written, which is the order the transcript shows them in.
 *
 * A room with nothing said in it sorts on when it was created, so a freshly made room
 * appears at the top where the user left it rather than at the bottom under everything.
