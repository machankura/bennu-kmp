/**
 * The path the room's id was derived at, `m/9420/0/0` style.
 *
 * Recorded rather than assumed. `SharedKeyDerivation.MARMOT_ADMIN_GROUP_PATH`
 * is the only path anything walks today, but a room derived at a second one
 * would be unfindable by a lookup that hardcodes the first, and the path is
 * also what rebuilds the `TweakCache` a signing session needs.
 *
 * Hardened indices are rejected on parse: hardened derivation needs the parent
 * private key, which in a threshold group nobody has, so a path carrying one
 * was never walked.
