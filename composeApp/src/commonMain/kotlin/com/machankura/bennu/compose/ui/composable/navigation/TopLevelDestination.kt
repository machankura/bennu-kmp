/**
 * The three destinations the navigation component switches between.
 *
 * The app has one screen that is genuinely a top-level destination -- [Messages], which
 * is the home feed -- and two surfaces that were one tap from it through the home screen's
 * app bar: the profile avatar in the leading slot and the search icon in the trailing one.
 * Promoting those two is an information-architecture decision rather than a component
 * swap, and it was taken deliberately: M3's caution is to swap only functionally
 * equivalent components, and a navigation bar holding a single item would have been
 * strictly worse than the app bar it replaced.
 *
 * The consequence is that the home screen's app bar no longer carries either icon. Two
 * routes to the same destination is what the caution is about; the navigation component is
 * now the one route, at every breakpoint.
 *
 * @property icon the item's icon, and the only thing shown when the rail is collapsed.
 * @property label the item's text, shown in the bar and in the expanded rail.
