/**
 * The slice of the relay layer a one-off publish needs.
 *
 * The same cut [LiveSubscriptionTransport] makes and for the same reason:
 * [RelaysSocketManager] starts collecting relay lists in its `init` and cannot be
 * stood up in a test, so a screen that hands it an event would otherwise have no
 * way to check what it does with the answers.
 *
 * Everything the app publishes as *itself* goes through the
 * `BroadcastNostrEventRequest` queue instead, which is durable and retried. This
 * exists for the one thing that must not: an event the group signed. The queue
 * hangs off a `NostrEvent` row, and a row for the group's event would put its post
 * into the home feed and offer it to every relay the sync loop reconciles with --
 * see `BroadcastGroupSignedEventViewModel` for the whole of that argument.
