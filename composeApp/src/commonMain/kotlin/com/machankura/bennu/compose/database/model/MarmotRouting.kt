/**
 * The address a room's kind:445 traffic is carried under, and the room it belongs to.
 *
 * A room's id and its routing id are two values, and were one until the current
 * profile. `ChatRoom.id` is the room's identity: for a room this app makes with a
 * threshold key it is the key derived from that key, the one the room signs as and
 * every chronicle is verified against (docs/shared-key-derivation.md). The routing
 * id is the `nostr_group_id` in the group's `0x8004` component, the `h` tag on every
 * kind:445, and v2 says of it: random, and never derived from any public key,
 * because a derivable address lets a relay link a group's traffic to the identity
 * behind it -- which here would be the key that authors the group's published
 * entries. So a current-profile room this app creates mints one at random.
 *
 * Every other room has a row whose routing id *is* its room id: legacy rooms, where
 * the `0xF2EE` extension's `nostr_group_id` is what the room was keyed on, and rooms
 * created by other clients, whose routing id is the only id they have. A room with
 * no row at all -- one from before this table -- is addressed by its own id, which
 * is what every reader falls back to. See docs/marmot-v2.md, Phase 4.
 *
 * [retiredAtEpoch] is for routing rotation, which v2 describes and nothing here
 * writes yet: a member "has to be able to map several routing ids to one group"
 * while the epochs that used a prior one are still inside the retention window.
