/**
 * The group saying it keeps coins on chain, at one account on one network.
 *
 * Every room with a key *could* receive coins without this -- the addresses are a
 * function of the threshold key -- and that is the wrong default for money. A
 * member should not be able to show an address the group never agreed to look
 * after, and somebody paying one deserves to know the group said so. So a wallet
 * exists when a quorum has signed one of these, and not before.
 *
 * ```
 *  member --[ 30320 proposal over a 30331 ]-> the room
 *  ...a signing session...
 *  everyone holds the signed 30331             "the group keeps a wallet at this account"
 * ```
 *
 * ### Trusted no further than it can be checked
 *
 * Content is the account's xpub; the tags carry the network, the account number
 * and the two descriptors. A reader accepts a statement only when the room signed
 * it *and* [GroupWalletDerivation.account] rederives every one of those values
 * from the room's threshold key -- the same two checks `GroupKeyStateEvent` asks
 * of a key state. The second is the load-bearing one. This is a record that the
 * group agreed, not a source of keys: nothing reads an address out of it, and a
 * statement naming any xpub but the rederived one is not the group's wallet,
 * whoever signed it.
 *
 * ### A guarded statement
 *
 * A subgroup whose birth certificate grants it guardian keys may open its wallet
 * *guarded*: every address carries a leaf per ancestor, and the statement is the
 * child's quorum agreeing to that. It carries the guardians as [GuardianTag]s
 * and the certificate itself, whole, so that a member who holds no key state --
 * one welcomed in after the founding -- can still check every address, and so
 * that an ancestor it is forwarded to can check where its own key came from.
 * See `docs/group-wallet-guardians.md`.
 *
 * ### Never on a relay
 *
 * The xpub is every address and the whole balance, to whoever has it. Like the
 * signing kinds this only ever lives inside an encryption a relay cannot open,
 * and nothing in the app sends a group-signed event to a relay.
 *
 * ### Why 30331
 *
 * Next to the signing family in the app's private inner-event space. 30327-30330
 * were taken by the chronicle, its request, the subgroup certificate and the
 * decline (the last also shared with the direct-message envelope), so this is the
 * first free number past them, and the transaction proposal that is opened
 * against it sits beside it at 30332.
