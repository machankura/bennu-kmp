/**
 * A member asking the group for its key, and a member answering -- the two
 * things a guarded wallet's grant is worked out from.
 *
 * A member's guarded wallet carries the group's leaf and its ancestors' leaves,
 * and the member's own device works them out before it asks the group to guard
 * anything: `GuardianDerivation.grant` over the group's threshold key and the
 * guardian keys in the group's own birth certificate. Both are read off the
 * group's verified key state, which only ceremony participants hold. A member
 * welcomed later has neither. See `docs/member-guarded-wallets.md`, D4.
 *
 * ```
 *  member without a key state  --[ 30336, no content         ]-> the room   "what does this group sign with?"
 *  member holding one          --[ 30336, the key + its cert ]-> the room
 *  the asking device checks the answer on its own
 * ```
 *
 * ### Nothing the answerer says is taken on its word
 *
 * The answer carries the threshold key, the path, and the certificate if the
 * group has one, and every one of them checks itself: the key at the path
 * rederives the room's id, and the certificate certifies that room and names
 * that key. A forged answer cannot name another key, and one that leaves out or
 * swaps the certificate gives a grant every signer refuses, because each signer
 * works the grant out again from its own key state.
 *
 * The signed key state itself is not carried: its row keeps what it said and not
 * the event, and nothing in it is needed beyond what checks itself.
 *
 * ### The group's policy on members' wallets, too
 *
 * An answer also carries, whole, the newest `MemberWalletPolicyEvent` the
 * answering device holds -- the other thing a late member needs before asking
 * for a wallet, and one MLS will not let them read from before their welcome.
 * It checks itself as well: the group's own room signed it. See
 * `docs/member-wallet-delay.md`, Phase 3.
 *
 * ### Never filed as key state
 *
 * An answer is read in one place, for one purpose, every time it is used. Filing
 * it into `GroupKeyState` would give every late member a key state and quietly
 * change what `GroupWalletManager.thresholdKeyFor` answers for them across the
 * app.
 *
 * ### Why 30336
 *
 * After the member wallet's certificate (30334) and request (30335).
