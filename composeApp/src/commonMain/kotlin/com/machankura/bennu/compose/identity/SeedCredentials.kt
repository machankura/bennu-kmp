/**
 * The credential a seed always implied.
 *
 * Until docs/multiple-profiles.md, a seed's nostr key was never written to the
 * credentials file: it was derived from the words at listing and from the running node
 * at activation, and the writers kept one key out of two files. That put the wallet
 * where the profile should be. Now the credentials file is the list of profiles and a
 * seed is a wallet attached to one, so every seed's key has to be in it -- written by
 * `IdentityWriter.writeMnemonic` for a seed created or restored from here on, and by
 * this for every seed that was already on the device.
 *
 * A named, idempotent write that runs from `SovereignWalletViewModel.listIdentities`,
 * beside `NostrCredentialManager.migrateFromNostrKeys` and for the same reason: a
 * listing that writes is a surprise, so the write is a step with a name, a result and
 * a test, rather than a side effect of reading. On a device with no seeds, or one
 * already repaired, it writes nothing.
