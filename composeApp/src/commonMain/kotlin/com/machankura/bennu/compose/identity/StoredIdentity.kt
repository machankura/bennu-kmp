/**
 * A profile this device holds something for, as listed before any of them is started.
 *
 * The credentials file is the list of profiles: a `Secret` entry for every key the
 * device can sign as, a `Public` one for every key it can only look at. `seed.dat` is
 * the list of wallets, and a wallet is *attached* to the profile whose key it derives
 * -- matched by public key, since a seed's key is written to the credentials file when
 * the seed is (`IdentityWriter.writeMnemonic`) and repaired into it for every seed
 * already here (`SeedCredentials.reconcile`). See docs/multiple-profiles.md, Phase 1.
 * The nostr public key is on every kind because it is the one thing they have in
 * common and the one thing that attaches a wallet to a profile or refuses a duplicate.
 *
 * On what this holds: `SovereignWalletViewModel.availableWallets` has always carried
 * decrypted words for the view model's life, because starting the node needs them.
 * [NostrSecret] and [Mnemonic] carry their key for the same reason and are no worse;
 * decrypting at activation instead would be an improvement for every kind and belongs
 * to all of them.
