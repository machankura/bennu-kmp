/**
 * Who a chronicle is for.
 *
 * **A hint, not access control.** The page is an ordinary group message and
 * every member can read it -- which is right, because it is their own history
 * going back to them. What this decides is who *acts*: a device that is not
 * named stores the page and applies nothing, since it already holds the work and
 * re-applying would rewrite every one of its rows to point at a chronicle page
 * rather than at the event that actually introduced it.
 *
 * So this is not a secret being kept from the group, and nothing downstream may
 * treat it as one. Encrypting a chronicle to one member was considered and
 * rejected in docs/member-chronicle.md: it protects nothing and costs a "sent a
 * private message" line per page in everyone's transcript.
