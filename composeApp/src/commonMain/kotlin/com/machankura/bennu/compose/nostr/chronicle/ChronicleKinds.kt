/**
 * The kinds a chronicle may carry, in the order they have to be applied.
 *
 * One list doing both jobs, because a separate allowlist is one more thing that
 * can disagree with the order it is applied in. The order is the database's, not
 * nostr's: where one kind's rows hang off another's, the one they hang off comes
 * first, so a page applies front to back.
 *
 * **It is an allowlist first.** Verification admits an event to the apply path on
 * the strength of the group's signature, which makes every kind the group has
 * ever signed replayable by any member at any time. A `GroupKeyStateEvent` is
 * group-signed and passes verification perfectly, so a chronicle carrying an old
 * one is a validly signed statement about what the room signs with, replayed by
 * whoever kept a copy. Nothing but this list stops it.
 *
 * A value rather than a constant so the machinery can be exercised without
 * making anything chroniclable in the app: the app's own list is
 * [ChronicleEvent.KINDS], and the tests hand in theirs.
