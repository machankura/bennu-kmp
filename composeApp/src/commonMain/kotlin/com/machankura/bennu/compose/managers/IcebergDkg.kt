/**
 * A distributed key generation for Iceberg, which ships only a trusted dealer.
 *
 * An Iceberg share is replicated secret sharing, not a Shamir point: every
 * `(t-1)`-subset `T` of the participants has its own 32-byte seed, held by every
 * participant *outside* `T`, and a participant's share is the seeds of the
 * subsets it is outside of, in the lexicographic rank order `rss.h` fixes. So a
 * DKG only has to agree each seed among its holders without any member of `T`
 * learning it:
 *
 * ```
 * round 1  each holder j of each T:  c[j,T] = random,  publish h[j,T] = H(commit, sid, T, j, c[j,T])
 * round 2  send c[j,T] to every other holder of T, encrypted to them
 * round 3  each k checks every c[j,T] it was sent against h[j,T], then
 *            s[T]  = H(seed, sid, T, c[j,T] for each holder j, ascending)
 *            share = 1 | n | t | k | s[T] for each T not containing k, in rank order
 *          and publishes its public share and a signature over the transcript
 * done     Iceberg.groupPublicKey over all n public shares
 * ```
 *
 * Why it is safe, in the three sentences it takes:
 *
 * - **Every seed is random.** `T` has `n - t + 1 >= t` holders and at most
 *   `t - 1` members are corrupt, so some holder's contribution is honest.
 * - **Every seed is secret from `T`.** Its contributions only go to its holders,
 *   so a coalition of `t - 1` lacks exactly the seed named after itself, which
 *   is the scheme's whole margin (`rss.h`).
 * - **Nobody chooses last.** Contributions are committed before any is revealed,
 *   so a contributor cannot grind the group key.
 *
 * A contributor who reveals something other than what it committed to is named
 * ([Fault.BadReveal]). One who commits to two different values in front of two
 * different members is not caught here; the transcript signature is what catches
 * that, because the two members then publish different transcript hashes.
 *
 * ### Repair, which RSS gives away
 *
 * Every seed a participant holds is also held by `n - t` others. A participant
 * that has lost its share can be sent its seeds again ([repairSeeds]); the share
 * it rebuilds ([repair]) must reproduce the public share it published, which is
 * the check on what it was sent. That replaces ChillDKG's recovery data.
 *
 * ### What this is not
 *
 * Reviewed. `iceberg.md` says the scheme must not protect anything of value, and
 * this protocol is newer than the scheme. It lives in the app rather than in the
 * bitcoin-kmp fork beside [Iceberg] only because it needs nothing from inside
 * the library; see the build table in `docs/group-lightning-wallet.md`.
 *
 * Every function here is pure over inputs the ritual has stored, as
 * [fr.acinq.bitcoin.crypto.dkg.chill.ChillDKG]'s are, so a ceremony resumes from
 * its persisted messages after the app is killed.
