/**
 * The spends a member can propose from the group's wallet: everything to one
 * address, which is what Phoenix's final wallet does, or an amount with change.
 *
 * Confirmed coins only, as Phoenix's send-all takes, and never a coin an open
 * proposal is already spending. Two proposals over one coin are not dangerous --
 * only one can confirm, and each has its own nonces -- but the second is a quorum
 * asked for nothing.
 *
 * A guardian building a spend from a descendant's guarded wallet -- a
 * [GroupSpend.Spender.Guardian] -- takes only coins its leaf's lock has already
 * let go of, puts that lock on every input, and weighs each input by its leaf
 * and control block. Its change, if any, goes back to the descendant.
 *
 * A spend can also *fund* a descendant's guarded wallet: a [Destination.Funding]
 * pays the receive address `GroupWalletState.fundingAddress` chose, and the PSBT
 * says so on that output, in the derivation field change already uses, so every
 * signer can derive it again. See `docs/guarded-wallet-funding.md`.
