/**
 * Asks whether to join a shared key ceremony somebody else opened.
 *
 * The first and most consequential of the three approvals. Publishing a host key
 * is what puts this member in the participant set, and the set is what `n` is
 * counted over — so a member who joins and then stops answering does not merely
 * fail to help, they hold the ceremony open for everybody else. Saying that
 * plainly here is the point of the screen.
 *
 * Until this is approved nothing has left the device, which is worth stating
 * outright: the member is being asked to start, not to continue.
