/**
 * The group's on-chain wallet keys, derived from its ChillDKG threshold key.
 *
 * A wallet address here is BIP86's -- a taproot key-path output with no script
 * tree -- at BIP86's own unhardened tail, `/<change>/<index>`, under an account
 * key that the threshold key is publicly tweaked to:
 *
 * ```
 * I   = HMAC-SHA512("bennu/group-wallet/account/v1", serP(K) || chainHash || ser32(account))
 * K_a = K + I[0:32]·G,   chain code I[32:64]       an ordinary depth-0 xpub
 * P   = xonly(CKDpub(CKDpub(K_a, change), index))  BIP86 internal key
 * Q   = P + H_TapTweak(P)·G                        BIP86 output key
 * ```
 *
 * See `docs/group-chain-wallet.md` for why each level is what it is. In short:
 * every hardened level of `m/86'/0'/0'` needs the parent private key, which in a
 * threshold group nobody holds; the ceremony is what isolates one group's key
 * from another's, and the account step does what `coin'` and `account'` do --
 * mainnet and test networks, and account 0 and account 1, are unrelated keys.
 * Below the account the derivation is plain BIP32, which is what lets the group
 * export a descriptor any watch-only wallet can follow.
 *
 * ### Not [SharedKeyDerivation], and never to be confused with it
 *
 * That object derives nostr keys -- the room's own id among them -- with x-only
 * tweaks at every step and a SHA-256 scalar. This one uses plain tweaks and
 * HMAC-SHA512 until the last step. The two never share a key, and the wallet
 * never sits on the room's key: a wallet at the room's key would be findable by
 * anyone who can see the room's id.
 *
 * ### The rule this inherits
 *
 * Every tweak is publicly computable from the threshold key, so a leaked private
 * key for any address recovers the group's threshold key -- the room, every
 * address of every account, and every event the group can sign. Nothing here or
 * anywhere else reconstructs one. The only export is the account xpub.
