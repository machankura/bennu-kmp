/**
 * A spend from a group's wallet, checked the way every member checks it before
 * putting their share behind it.
 *
 * Nothing here trusts the proposer. A PSBT says which coins it spends, where
 * under the wallet's account each one is, and which outputs are change; every
 * one of those claims is rederived from the account and refused if it does not
 * reproduce the script it is about. The sighashes are then computed here, from
 * the PSBT itself -- the counterpart of rebuilding a proposed event's id from
 * its fields rather than taking the id on the wire.
 *
 * ### Why a PSBT's amounts can be believed without fetching anything
 *
 * Before taproot a signer had to see each spent output's whole transaction to
 * trust its amount, or a proposer could lie it down and turn the difference into
 * fee. BIP341's sighash commits to every spent amount and every spent script, so
 * a lie here produces signatures the network rejects -- not a larger fee. That
 * is what lets a member with no node of their own, and so no way to look a coin
 * up, still sign safely: the worst a lying proposer gets is a transaction nobody
 * can mine.
 *
 * ### Two ways to sign a coin
 *
 * The wallet's own group signs each input on its address's key path. An
 * ancestor of a guarded wallet signs through its leaf instead -- a [Spender.Guardian]
 * -- and then every input's sighash is BIP342's over that leaf, its sequence is
 * the leaf's lock, its signature verifies against the leaf key, and its witness
 * is the leaf and its control block. Everything else above holds unchanged: the
 * coins are still the descendant's, at places under its account, and each claim
 * is still rederived rather than believed. See `docs/group-wallet-guardians.md`.

     * A [funding] output -- one paying a descendant's guarded wallet -- carries
     * its derivation the same way, under the descendant's account rather than
     * this one, so it is never mistaken for change and a signer holding that
     * wallet can derive it again. See `docs/guarded-wallet-funding.md`.
