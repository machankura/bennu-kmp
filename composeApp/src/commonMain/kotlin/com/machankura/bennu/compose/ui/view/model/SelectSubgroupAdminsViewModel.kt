/**
 * Who runs a subgroup, what it is called, on what quorum, and whether its wallet
 * is guarded.
 *
 * All four are settled here and nowhere else. The wallet policy rides the
 * proposal like the threshold and is signed into the birth certificate by the
 * parent's quorum -- `docs/subgroup-wallet-policy.md`. The name and the admin set are
 * carried into the birth certificate, so they are what the parent's admins will
 * be asked to approve; the threshold cannot move afterwards at all, because
 * ChillDKG hashes it and the host keys into the session identity, so `t` is fixed
 * the moment the proposal goes out and a group that disagrees about it gets no
 * key rather than a weak one.
 *
 * It is also the one value picked *for* other people, and consent survives that:
 * `t` rides on the proposal, every invitee's `acceptProposal` re-checks it against
 * `quorumRange` and drops a proposal outside it, and the host-key approval gate is
 * where each of them agrees to the `t`-of-`n` they can now see.
 *
 * Confirming opens the ceremony -- a ritual proposal in the **parent's** room,
 * p-tagged to the picked admins -- and hands back to the parent's transcript,
 * where every admin answers the ceremony from the same place. See
 * `docs/subgroups.md`.
