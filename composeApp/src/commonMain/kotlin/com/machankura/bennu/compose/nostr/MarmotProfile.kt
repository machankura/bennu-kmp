/**
 * Which Marmot profile a group, a KeyPackage or a bundle is on.
 *
 * The spec was reorganised from the MIP-era layout -- one monolithic `0xF2EE` group
 * data extension, no proof that a leaf's signature key belongs to its account -- into
 * the *current profile*: group state as versioned components in an
 * `app_data_dictionary`, and every member leaf carrying an account identity proof.
 * quartz reads both; the reference engine refuses to add a member to a legacy group
 * at all. So the profile is the thing that decides which clients a room can reach,
 * and it is stored explicitly rather than inferred so that a row written by a build
 * that knew only one is read as that one.
 *
 * See docs/marmot-v2.md.
