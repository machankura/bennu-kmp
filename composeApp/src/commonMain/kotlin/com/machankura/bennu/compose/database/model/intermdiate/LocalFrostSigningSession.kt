/**
 * One signing session with everything a list of them has to show.

 * signing is going, and the items say what is being signed. A screen listing a
 * room's proposals needs both of every one of them, and asking per session would
 * be one query per row.
 *
 * The proposer is joined for the same reason the transcript joins a sender --
 * so a rename follows, and so a member who has only ever been seen as a pubkey
 * is not stuck on the placeholder a profile is created with.
