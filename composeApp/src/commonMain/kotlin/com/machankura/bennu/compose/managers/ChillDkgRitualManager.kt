/**
 * Runs a ChillDKG ritual in a group's room, on whichever transport that room has.
 *
 * The participant set is who the proposal p-tags, the member who opens the ritual
 * is the coordinator, and every protocol message travels on the kinds in
 * [DkgRitualEvents] — as a gift-wrapped rumor in a NIP-17 room and as an MLS
 * application message in a Marmot one, which are the two pipelines chat messages
 * already use, so there is no second transport to operate.
 *
 * ### Two transports, because a subgroup's ceremony is held by its parent
 *
 * A group's own ceremony runs in the NIP-17 room its members share: there is no
 * MLS tree yet, and cannot be, since the room the key will make is derived from
 * the key the ceremony is about to produce.
 *
 * A *subgroup's* ceremony runs in the **parent's** Marmot room. The parent
 * already exists, already holds exactly the people a subgroup can be drawn from,
 * and already signs the child's birth certificate there — so the alternative was
 * a sibling NIP-17 room whose id was an aggregate of the child's admins, which
 * meant one admin set could hold one subgroup ever. [broadcast] is the only place
 * that knows the difference; everything above it is the same protocol either way.
 *
 * The p-tags stay on **both**, unlike `FrostSigningManager`'s. There they are an
 * address list and a Marmot message needs none; here the p-tag set *is* the
 * participant set every device derives `n` from, and in the parent's room that is
 * a subset of who can read the message. Inside MLS encryption, naming them leaks
 * nothing.
 *
 * The coordinator is a participant too. ChillDKG treats the coordinator as
 * untrusted (it relays but cannot learn secrets or bias the key), so opening
 * the ritual buys it no authority here — only the job of aggregating. That is
 * why any member may open one: there is nothing to gain by being the one who
 * does.
 *
 * ### Why this is driven by arriving messages
 *
 * Every step is a pure function of inputs this device has already stored, so
 * there is no long-lived in-memory session to lose. Each inbound message is
 * persisted and then the ritual is asked whether it can move; if the app dies
 * mid-round it picks up exactly where it left off on the next message.
 *
 * [advance] therefore decides what to do from what is *stored* — "is my round-1
 * message out yet?" — and never from how far [DkgSession.stage] says the ritual
 * got. The stage is a label for the UI. Gating the work on it would mean a
 * device killed between "record the stage" and "publish the message" never
 * publishes at all, and a DKG stalls for everyone when one member stalls.

     *
     * In a NIP-17 room it is a gift-wrap payload: `NotaryViewModel` picks it up,
     * seals a copy per participant and broadcasts. In a Marmot room it is an
     * unprocessed inner event, MLS-encrypted and broadcast as a kind:445 for the
     * room. Both are the paths chat messages already take, which is why this
     * needs no transport of its own.
     *
     * **The p-tags go on both**, which is where this parts company with
     * `FrostSigningManager.broadcast`. There a p-tag is an address, and a group
     * event needs none because it is encrypted to the whole tree. Here the p-tag
     * set *is* the participant set: `acceptProposal` builds `n` out of it on
     * every device, and `n` is hashed into the session identity, so dropping the
     * tags in a Marmot room would leave every receiver unable to say what
     * ceremony they had been invited to. In the parent's room they are also the
     * only thing separating the subgroup's admins from everybody else who can
     * read the message, and naming them inside MLS encryption leaks nothing.
     *
     * Off the session rather than off the room, for that same reason. A
     * subgroup's ceremony runs in the parent's room, so the room's roster would
     * invite the whole parent into the child's key.
