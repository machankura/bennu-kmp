/**
 * All six schemes, side by side, over the components that carry text.
 *
 * The one place the medium and high contrast schemes can be looked at. They are reachable
 * in the app only through a platform setting -- and on android 12 and up, only with
 * dynamic colour switched off -- so without this they are values in `Color.kt` that
 * nobody has seen.
 *
 * Over components rather than over screens, and that is the point of it. Contrast is a
 * property of the scheme: `ColorSchemeContrastTest` measures every pair in all six, so
 * what a render adds is not proof but judgement -- whether `secondaryContainer` still
 * reads as a container in high contrast, whether the outline is doing its job. Six renders
 * of this answer that for the whole app; six renders of each of 51 screens would answer it
 * 51 times.
