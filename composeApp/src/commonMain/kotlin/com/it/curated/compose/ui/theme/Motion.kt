 * per-platform accessibility setting, it can change while the app is running, and somebody
 * who turns it on because motion makes them ill should not have to restart the app.

/**
 * The transitions between navigation destinations.
 *
 * **What this replaces.** All 43 routes took navigation-compose's default, which on
 * android and desktop is `fadeIn(tween(700))` / `fadeOut(tween(700))`. That is not the
 * hard cut the plan expected -- but 700 milliseconds is roughly three times M3's own
 * duration for a full-screen transition, and a `tween` written into a library's internals
 * is not a decision this app made. Both directions now come from the theme's
 * [androidx.compose.material3.MotionScheme], which is where phase 1 put the one decision
 * about how this app moves.
 *
 * **Shape.** M3's shared-axis transition for forward and backward navigation: the arriving
 * screen slides in from the trailing edge while the leaving one slides out toward the
 * leading edge, both fading. Going back mirrors it, so the direction of travel is legible
 * rather than a dissolve that looks the same either way. `slideIntoContainer` is
 * layout-direction aware, so an RTL locale gets the mirror image for free.
 *
 * Spatial specs for the slide and effects specs for the fade, which is the distinction the
 * scheme draws: spatial motion is springy because it moves something, effects motion is not
 * because a fading colour that overshoots looks like a fault.
 *
 * Typed for `NavBackStackEntry` rather than star-projected. These are only ever handed to
 * a `NavHost`, and a star projection would make every call site cast.
