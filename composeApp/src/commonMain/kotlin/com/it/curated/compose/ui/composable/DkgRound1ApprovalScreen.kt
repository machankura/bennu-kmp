/**
 * Asks whether to contribute to the key itself.
 *
 * The step where the member's own secret material first shapes the outcome.
 * Joining settled who is in the ceremony; this settles what the key is, and once
 * it is out there is no version of the key that does not include it.
 *
 * The participant set is worth showing here rather than a count, because this is
 * the last moment at which "who am I making a key with" is still a question the
 * member can act on — everyone is now known, and the ceremony has not yet
 * committed to anything.
