/**
 * One ChillDKG ritual, as this device sees it.
 *
 * Deliberately stores inputs rather than protocol state. `ChillDKG`'s
 * participant and coordinator steps are pure functions of their inputs — the
 * only randomness enters through the `random`/`auxRand` arguments — so keeping
 * [round1Random], [round2AuxRandom] and the received messages is enough to
 * recompute every intermediate state on demand. That is what lets a ritual
 * survive the app being killed halfway through, which matters because a DKG
 * needs every member to finish and members close apps.
 *
 * [round1Random] and [round2AuxRandom] are secret: they reconstruct this
 * device's share. They live here under the same "encrypted local storage"
 * assumption `MlsGroupState` already relies on.
