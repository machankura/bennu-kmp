 * NOTICE is deliberately absent. It carries no subscription id, so it is
 * delivered to every collector on the socket — treating it as terminal would
 * let one relay notice tear down every unrelated subscription at once.
 *
 * NEG-MSG is absent too, and for a sharper reason. Negentropy is a multi-round
 * protocol: the initiator opens with fingerprints over its whole set, and each
 * NEG-MSG the relay sends back resolves some ranges into id lists while
 * splitting others into finer fingerprints the client must answer with another
 * NEG-MSG. Only the ranges that come back as id lists produce have/need ids at
 * all, and a message carries 16 buckets — so one round says almost nothing about
 * a set of any size. Treating the first NEG-MSG as terminal made every sync a
 * single round and abandoned a reconciliation the relay was still in the middle
 * of. A negentropy exchange instead ends when `reconcile()` reports no further
 * message to send, which only the caller can see (see SynchronizationViewModel).
