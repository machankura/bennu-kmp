/**
 * Holds the chat subscriptions open for as long as it runs, so relays push new events at us
 * instead of us asking for them once per screen.
 *
 * See `docs/long-running-sync.md`. The short version: every chat sync in this app used to be
 * a pull — a screen queues a request row, a pump drains it, the relay answers, the
 * subscription is closed — which is structurally incapable of delivering a message that
 * arrives one second after EOSE.
 *
 * Two subscriptions, on every DM relay:
 *  - [GIFT_WRAP_SUB_ID], kind 1059 p-tagged to us: direct messages, and the Marmot Welcome
 *    events that make us a member of a group.
 *  - [GROUP_SUB_ID_PREFIX]`<n>`, kind 445 h-tagged with the groups we belong to, in chunks.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT share `SynchronizationViewModel`'s subscription semaphore. That
 * budget is four permits across all relays, sized for requests that finish; a subscription
 * that never finishes would hold one forever and permanently halve the backfill throughput.
 * The two budgets have to be read together against what a relay will actually tolerate
 * (commonly ~20 per connection), which they comfortably are.
