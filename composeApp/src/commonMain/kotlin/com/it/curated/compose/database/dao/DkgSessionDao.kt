     * room, so that room holds a completed ceremony whose key is the *child's*,

     * reached by every parent member who holds no key-state row -- which is
     * every member welcomed after the parent's own ceremony.
     *
     * A ceremony run to make a subgroup is never the room's own key, and
     * `parentChatRoomId` is the only thing that has to be read to know it. It is
     * an unverified claim, but not a dangerous one here: the direction it can be
     * abused in is a member *excluding* a ceremony from this answer, and a
     * ceremony they can exclude is one they proposed, whose key they would
     * simply not have proposed at all.
