/**
 * One FROST signing session, as this device sees it.
 *
 * Like [DkgSession] this stores *inputs* rather than protocol state, so a
 * session survives the app being killed halfway through: every step is
 * recomputed from what is on the row. Unlike a DKG that choice is not merely
 * convenient here, it is forced -- `fr.acinq.bitcoin.crypto.frost.SecretNonce`
 * cannot be serialised and refuses to be used twice, by design.
 *
 * ### One session, several events
 *
 * A session signs a batch of one or more events, held as [FrostSigningItem]
 * rows. What lives here is what the whole batch shares, and the split is not a
 * matter of taste: an item's nonce, message and signature are the terms of
 * `s = k + e·x` with `e = H(R‖P‖m)`, so sharing any of them across two messages
 * is how a secret share is extracted. Everything on this row is outside that
 * equation.
 *
 * | shared, and so here | per item, and so on [FrostSigningItem] |
 * |---|---|
 * | ceremony, threshold, participant count | the unsigned event and its id |
 * | [signerIds] and the signer set | nonce seed, and the nonce from it |
 * | [derivationPath] and its tweak cache | aggregated nonce |
 * | [signApprovedAt] -- one decision | the signature |
 *
 * ### The nonce, and why one item means one message
 *
 * [FrostSigningItem.nonceRandom] is secret, and regenerating this device's nonce
 * from it is safe for exactly one reason: an item signs one message and can
 * never be made to sign another. `SecretNonce.generate` mixes the message in, so
 * the same randomness under a different message would be a different nonce --
 * but the same randomness under the same message with two *different* aggregated
 * nonces would produce two partial signatures over one secret nonce, which is
 * how a secret share is extracted.
 *
 * Two rules keep that impossible, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - [FrostSigningItem.eventId] is written when the session is created, and a
 *    proposal that disagrees with the batch it already holds is rejected rather
 *    than applied.
 *  - [FrostSigningItem.aggregatedNonce] and [signerIds] are written once, and
 *    written together. A second, different signer set for the same session is
 *    ignored, not honoured.
