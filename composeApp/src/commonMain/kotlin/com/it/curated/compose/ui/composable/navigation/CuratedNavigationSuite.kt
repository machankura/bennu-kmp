/**
 * The navigation bar, collapsed rail or expanded rail, around whatever the nav host draws.
 *
 * **Which component, at which breakpoint**, straight from the layout foundation's table:
 *
 * | breakpoint          | component            |
 * |---------------------|----------------------|
 * | compact             | navigation bar       |
 * | medium, expanded    | collapsed rail       |
 * | large, extra-large  | expanded rail        |
 *
 * `NavigationSuiteScaffoldDefaults.navigationSuiteType` is not used, and the difference is
 * the last row: it stops at `WideNavigationRailCollapsed` and never returns the expanded
 * rail, because it classifies with the three-value window size class rather than the five
 * breakpoints the May 2026 revision published. Deriving the type from [Breakpoint] instead
 * keeps one source of truth for window width in the app and reaches the row the library's
 * default cannot.
 *
 * **Hidden on everything else.** [NavigationSuiteType.None] draws no component at all, and
 * that is the case for every screen that is not one of the three: onboarding, a chat room,
 * a signing screen, the desktop passphrase gate. A navigation bar belongs on the
 * destinations it switches between; on a screen reached by pushing a route and left by
 * coming back it is a permanent invitation to lose your place.
 *
 * @param navController the host's controller, read for the current destination and used to
 *   navigate. Passed rather than hoisted into callbacks because the top-level navigation
 *   options below -- `saveState`, `restoreState`, `launchSingleTop` -- are the point of the
 *   component and belong with it rather than at three call sites.
 * @param breakpoint the window's breakpoint, which decides the component.
 * @param activeUserPublicKey the signed-in key, or `null` before anybody has signed in --
 *   in which case no destination has a route and the component stays hidden.
 * @param activeProfileNostrEventId the metadata event addressing the active profile, or
 *   `null` until it has been read. Only [TopLevelDestination.Profile] needs it.
