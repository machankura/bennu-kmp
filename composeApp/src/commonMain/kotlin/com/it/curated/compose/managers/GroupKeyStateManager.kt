/**
 * Puts what key a room signs with to the group, and files what the group says.
 *
 * [propose] asks for it before the room exists; every device [record]s the state
 * when the signing session behind it produces a signature, or [adopt]s it the
 * moment the room it names comes into being. All three ends land on the same
 * [GroupKeyState] row, which is what a signing request is resolved against --
 * see `FrostSigningManager.completedKey`.
 *
 * ### Why this is proposed rather than announced
 *
 * It used to be announced: the coordinator wrote the row, said so in the room,
 * and every receiver kept the statement if the room's id rederived from the key
 * it named. That check is still here and still the thing safety rests on -- a
 * state that does not rederive the room it names is dropped, whoever it came
 * from -- but it left the *first* thing a group ever does as the one thing one
 * member decides alone.
 *
 * So it goes through the same door everything else the group says goes through.
 * A room's key state is a `FrostSigningEvents.PROPOSAL` over a
 * [GroupKeyStateEvent], and the state exists when a quorum has signed it, on
 * every device at once, authored by the group's own key.
 *
 * ### Why it is signed before the room is created
 *
 * ```
 *  ceremony completes in the NIP-17 room
 *  coordinator --[ 30320 proposal over a 30326 ]-> the same NIP-17 room
 *  ...a quorum signs, on gift wraps...
 *  every device holds the signed 30326, naming a room nobody has made yet
 *  coordinator creates the admin room --> adopt() files the state as it appears
 * ```
 *
 * It used to be the new room's first application message, which meant the group
 * created a room and only afterwards agreed what it signs with. Two things were
 * wrong with that order. The room's founding fact was settled after the
 * founding, so a session that never reached a quorum left a live room whose
 * every member had to fall back to rederiving; and the members who had to sign
 * it were exactly the ones the room had just been created to hold, so a member
 * whose key package could not be found was excluded from a decision they held a
 * share of.
 *
 * Signed first, the state is a precondition of the room rather than an
 * afterthought: the group agrees what it signs with while it is still only a
 * ceremony and a NIP-17 chat, and the room is created already knowing. That is
 * what puts `FrostSigningManager` on two transports -- see [propose].

     * event to check that -- not even the room, which is why this can be signed
     * before the room exists at all.

     * Refuses to propose from a room that is neither the subject nor the

     * identity no room answers to. Refuses a state that fails

     * device derived the subject room from one key and proposed another.
     *
     * [key] is handed to the signing session rather than looked up from the
     * room, because no room here has a key state -- establishing one is exactly
     * what this session exists to do.

     * A session of one, always, and never batched with anything else. A batch is
     * all-or-nothing, so it is only as available as its worst item -- and this is

     * it names rederive from the key it names? And did the group say it -- does
     * the signature verify against the identity of that same key?
     *
     * The first is the one that cannot be given up. Acting on a state naming a
     * key the room was not derived from means signing with a share that will not
     * aggregate, or worse, treating a key the group does not hold as the key the
     * group holds. It is also entirely independent of who is speaking: a member
     * with no share, or none of the ceremony at all, can state a true state and
     * it is still true.
     *
     * The second is what the proposal flow buys. It does not make a state truer;
     * it makes a state the group's, so that the record of what a room signs with
     * is a thing a quorum agreed to rather than a thing its creator said.
     *
     * ### Which room the state is about
     *
     * The one its own `d` tag names, not the one it arrived in. Those used to be
     * required to agree and a mismatch was dropped, which was the right rule
     * while a state was made in the room it described -- and is the wrong one
     * now that a group signs its state before creating that room, so the two are
     * ordinarily different by design.
     *
     * Nothing is given up by that. The check the drop was standing in for is
     * still made, and made against the *named* room: the state has to rederive
     * it, and the signature has to be by the key that rederivation reaches. A
     * state can therefore only ever be about a room it derives, whatever room it
     * turned up in, so nobody can point one room at another room's key by
     * putting it through the wrong door.
     *
     * [chatRoomId] -- where it arrived -- is only the fallback for a state that
     * names no room at all, and appears in the logs.
