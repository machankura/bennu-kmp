/**
 * One signing message from one member, keyed so a duplicate delivery overwrites
 * rather than accumulates — relays redeliver, and feeding the same nonce in
 * twice would make the coordinator's signer set the wrong length.
 *
 * Covers the nonce and the partial signature; the coordinator's own broadcasts
 * live on [FrostSigningSession] because there is only ever one of each.
 *
 * Keyed on `(sessionId, signerPublicKey, kind)`, which also means a member
 * cannot replace their own nonce once the coordinator has aggregated it — a
 * second nonce from the same signer overwrites the first, and the aggregate
 * built from it simply stops matching. The session's own write-once rule on the
 * aggregate is what makes that a stalled session rather than a leaked share.
