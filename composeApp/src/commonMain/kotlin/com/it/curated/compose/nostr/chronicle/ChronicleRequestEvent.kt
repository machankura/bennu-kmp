/**
 * 30328
 *
 * "I hold none of this group's work. Send it."
 *
 * The reliable half of handing a new member the group's history, and the reason
 * [ChronicleEvent] is not simply pushed at them when they are invited.
 *
 * A push from the inviter is an application message in the epoch the add
 * created. If it reaches the invitee before their Welcome does -- different
 * transports, no ordering guarantee -- `MarmotInboundManager` drops it outright,
 * because a message from an epoch ahead of the local one is dropped and not
 * deferred. Nothing is retried and the inviter sees a success. That is the
 * failure mode described in docs/marmot-membership.md, arriving here in a new
 * costume.
 *
 * A request cannot lose that race, because sending one *is* the proof it was
 * won: a device that can put an application message into the room has processed
 * its Welcome and is at the group's epoch.
 *
 * It also covers three cases no invite-time push can reach, all of which look
 * identical from inside the database and are therefore answered by one rule:
 *
 *  - a reinstall, whose rows are gone and whose invite is long past;
 *  - a second device, which was never invited at all;
 *  - a chronicle that was sent and lost.
 *
 * Carries nothing. The room is the envelope, the asker is the MLS sender, and
 * what they are missing is "all of it" -- a cursor would have to be a position
 * in a dependency graph rather than a timestamp, and is deliberately left out of
 * the first version.
