 * screen a character at a time, and the eye loses its place in an undivided run
 * of hex -- the same reason a fingerprint or an account number is grouped.
 *
 * And a run of hex has no space in it, so Compose has nowhere to break the line:
 * it lays the whole thing out on one and lets it run off the side of the sheet,
 * where the end of the key cannot be read at all. The spaces are the break
 * opportunities. Nothing is copied from these -- the copy button takes the
 * signed event, which is not grouped -- so the display can be shaped for reading
 * without a paste losing the value.
