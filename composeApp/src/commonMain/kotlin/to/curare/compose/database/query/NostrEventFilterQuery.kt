/**
 * Translates a [SynchronizationFilter] into the SQL that selects exactly the events a relay
 * would return for the same NIP-01 filter.
 *
 * Negentropy compares two sets that are both defined by the *same* filter: ours, built here,
 * and the relay's, built from the filter carried in NEG-OPEN. Any constraint we fail to apply
 * locally makes our set a superset of the relay's, and every extra row comes back as an id the
 * relay is "missing" — which this app then schedules as a broadcast. Any constraint we apply
 * more tightly makes it a subset, and the difference comes back as ids to re-download that we
 * already have. So the value here is not just tidiness: a filter clause that is silently
 * dropped turns reconciliation into busywork in both directions.
 *
 * This replaced a chain of hand-written special cases that between them could not express
 * `until` at all, ignored `tags` whenever `authors` was also set, and fell back to
 * "kind 1 text notes" for any filter shape it did not recognise.
 *
 * Semantics mirror quartz's `FilterMatcher`, which is what the relays this app talks to
 * implement:
 *  - `ids`/`authors`/`kinds`: membership; a present-but-empty list matches nothing.
 *  - `tags`: AND between tag names, OR between the values of one name.
 *  - `tagsAll`: AND between tag names, AND between the values of one name.
 *  - `since`/`until`: **inclusive** on both ends.
