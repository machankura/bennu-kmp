     * this queue but a successful seal, so one payload that cannot be sealed used to be
     * the whole queue. That is not hypothetical here -- `sealGiftWrapPayload` refuses a
     * payload belonging to an MLS room outright, and a Welcome whose joiner published no
     * key package produces no wraps at all. Either one returns leaving `giftWrapSealId`
     * null, and every payload behind it waited on a row that would never move.
     *
     * `id` breaks the tie because `createdAt` is stored to the second; there was no
     * ordering here at all before, so which row was "the head" was whatever SQLite
     * happened to return first.
