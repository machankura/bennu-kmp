     * Everything this key has queued for the group and not yet sent, oldest first.
     *
     * A backlog, not a head. The only exit from this queue is a successful send: the
     * row is stamped with the group event it became, in the same transaction that
     * writes that event. So a row that cannot be sent does not leave, and while the
     * notary was handed one row at a time that row *was* the queue -- a message that
     * will never encrypt (a room whose MLS state is gone, a direct message to a key
     * that is no longer a member) sat at the head and every message queued behind it
     * waited on it forever. Not just in its own room, either: the filter is the
     * sender's key, so one wedged room silenced every group this device belongs to.
     * Nothing reports it; the messages simply stay unsealed, which is what they are.
     *
     * Handing over the whole backlog lets the caller fail one row without losing the
     * rest. It must still work through them in order and one at a time: each send
     * ratchets the room's MLS state forward and saves it, and the next send in that
     * room is encrypted against what the last one left behind.
     *
     * `id` breaks the tie because `createdAt` is stored to the second and a burst of
     * sends shares one. Ordering that is only ever "some row with this timestamp"
     * would let two passes disagree about what comes next.
