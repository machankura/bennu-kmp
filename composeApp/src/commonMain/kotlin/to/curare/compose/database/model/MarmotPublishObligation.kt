 * Publish-before-apply (`protocol-core/publish-lifecycle.md`): a locally generated
 * group-state change must not become canonical until a relay in its scope has
 * acknowledged it, and the record has to be durable *before* anything is broadcast
 * -- publishing first and recording after leaves a crash window in which peers hold
 * a commit this device has no memory of preparing, and the next start would mint a
 * replacement, forking the group against everyone who took the first one.
 *
 * The bytes are the library's own encoding of `MarmotPublishObligation` -- the
 * outbound MLS bytes, their recipient scope, the state they were made from and the
 * state they would make canonical -- opaque here, because the gate decodes them.
 * See docs/marmot-v2.md, Phase 6.
