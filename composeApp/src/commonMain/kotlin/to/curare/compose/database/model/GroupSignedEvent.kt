/**
 * An event the group's own key put a signature to, kept as the group made it.
 *
 * A quorum signing something is the most expensive thing this app does and,
 * until this table, the least recorded: `FrostSigningManager.complete` verified
 * the signature, handed the event to `ChatMessage.applyInnerEvent`, and let it
 * go. What survived was whatever the row it became happened to keep -- an
 * artifact keeps its `signature`, a contributor list keeps nothing at all, and a
 * kind with no arm in `applyInnerEvent` keeps nothing anywhere. The signature is
 * the group's statement; the rows are one reading of it. This is where the
 * statement itself lives.
 *
 * ### Why the whole event, and not a pointer to one
 *
 * There is nothing to point at. A group-signed event never travels between
 * members as itself -- the outbound pipeline re-authors rumors as their sender
 * and would strip the signature off -- so it is not a `NostrEvent`, and it is not
 * a `MarmotInnerEvent` either, since no member sent it. Every device derives it
 * from a signing session it took part in, or is handed it in a chronicle. The
 * columns are `NostrEvent`'s so that what is stored is an event rather than a
 * summary of one, which is what makes [verifies] answerable from the row alone.
 *
 * The one way one reaches a relay is a member sending it there by hand -- from
 * `BroadcastGroupSignedEventScreen`, or every accepted entry at once from the
 * entries screen -- and that path serialises the row straight to the pool
 * without ever making a `NostrEvent` of it -- see
 * `BroadcastGroupSignedEventViewModel` for why a row would be the wrong shape.
 *
 * ### The derivation path
 *
 * [publicKey] is the group's threshold key walked to [derivationPath], and for a
 * room that walk is also [chatRoomId] -- see `docs/shared-key-derivation.md`,
 * where the room's id and the key it signs as are one value. Storing the path is
 * what lets a reader get from a signature back to the ceremony behind it: the
 * threshold key alone does not say which of a group's rooms signed, and a room
 * id alone cannot be walked backwards. `GroupKeyState` records the same path for
 * the room; this records it for the event, so an event stays checkable after the
 * room's state is gone or was never known.
 *
 * Null means the untweaked threshold key itself, which is what a room not
 * derived from the key signs as -- the same meaning it carries on
 * [FrostSigningSession.derivationPath], which is where it is copied from.
