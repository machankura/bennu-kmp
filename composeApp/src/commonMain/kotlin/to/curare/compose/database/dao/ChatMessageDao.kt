/**
 * The room's transcript, newest first -- the order the feed's `reverseLayout` draws from the
 * bottom up, so the first row is the line sitting above the composer.
 *
 * `id DESC` is not decoration. [to.curare.compose.database.converters.CurareConverters]
 * stores an `Instant` as epoch seconds, so lines written inside one second tie: a ceremony
 * puts a dozen into a room faster than that, and a request with the answer it triggers
 * routinely lands inside one. `createdAt DESC` alone left those to whatever order the sorter
 * produced -- the rows as scanned, which under a descending query drew a same-second burst
 * backwards, and is free to change under a new index or a different plan, swapping two lines
 * in a transcript the user has already read.
 *
 * The key [ChatRoomDao] already breaks its last-message tie on, which is what makes the chat
 * list's preview and the bottom of the room it opens name the same line.
 *
 * One constant for both reads because they are the same list: the snapshot a screen loads
 * with and the flow it then follows must not order it differently.
