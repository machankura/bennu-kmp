/**
 * What a `BroadcastNostrEventRequest.status` can be, and how a relay's answer
 * becomes one.
 *
 * Four of these were string literals scattered over the sync pump, the
 * navigation gate and the DAO's requeue; the fifth is new. [REJECTED] is a
 * relay's `["OK", id, false, reason]` with a reason that will not change on a
 * retry -- `blocked:`, `invalid:`, `pow:`, `restricted:` -- and is the one
 * terminal status the requeue on launch leaves alone: the same bytes sent to
 * the same relay get the same answer. A `rate-limited:` or `error:` refusal is
 * [FAILED] like a timeout, because those do change. A `duplicate:` refusal is
 * [PUBLISHED]: the relay is saying it already has the event, which is what
 * published means, and it is the answer a byte-identical retry of a commit
 * gets from a relay that took the first copy.
 *
 * The distinction matters most to publish-before-apply: a commit's obligation
 * is discarded only when every relay in its scope has [REJECTED] it, and stays
 * pending through any number of [FAILED]s. See docs/marmot-v2.md, Phase 6.
