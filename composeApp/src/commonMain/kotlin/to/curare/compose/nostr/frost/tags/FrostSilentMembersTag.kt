/**
 * The share holders a coordinator has heard nothing from, carried on a resent
 * proposal.
 *
 * A proposer can resend what the proposer wrote, and nothing else: a nonce or a
 * refusal relayed by somebody else is filed under the relayer -- see
 * `FrostSigningManager.record`, which keys a signer's message on the inner
 * event's own `pubKey` -- and for a refusal that is a way to manufacture one.
 * So the resend names the quiet members instead, and their own devices
 * republish what they already said, under the keys that said it.
 *
 * It names rather than counts because a count cannot be acted on. A device
 * reading this tag is asking one question -- am I in it -- and the answer has
 * to be about them specifically.
 *
 * Only the coordinator's tag is honoured, and only to republish messages that
 * are already on file. Nothing here can talk a device into publishing a nonce
 * its owner has not approved; that gate is `advance`'s, and this does not reach
 * it. See `FrostSigningManager.republishOwn`.
 *
 * Carrying it leaks nothing. On Marmot every nonce is a group event the whole
 * room received, and on NIP-17 every member is p-tagged on every message, so
 * who has spoken is not a secret this could give away.
