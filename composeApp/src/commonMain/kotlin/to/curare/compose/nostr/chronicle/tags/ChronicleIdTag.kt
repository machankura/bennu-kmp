/**
 * Ties the pages of one chronicle together.
 *
 * A chronicle is more than one event and its pages arrive in no particular
 * order, so a receiver has to be able to tell page 2 of this chronicle from page 2
 * of somebody else's. Two members answering the same request is the ordinary
 * case rather than the odd one -- nothing stops them, and nothing should, since
 * an incomplete answer is exactly what a second answer fixes -- and without an
 * id their pages would interleave into one sequence that is neither.
 *
 * Fresh random bytes per chronicle, not derived from anything. Two members
 * assembling the same rows must not collide on an id, because their page counts
 * will differ whenever their databases do.
