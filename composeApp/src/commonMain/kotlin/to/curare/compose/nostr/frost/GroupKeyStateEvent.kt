/**
 * What key a Marmot room signs with, signed by the group whose key it is.
 *
 * Nobody announces this; the group *agrees* it, and does so before the room it
 * is about exists. What the ceremony's coordinator puts into the NIP-17 room the
 * ceremony ran in is a [FrostSigningEvents.PROPOSAL] carrying this event
 * unsigned, and the state comes into existence when a quorum has signed it --
 * the same shape a dialect or an artifact is created in.
 *
 * ```
 *  coordinator --[ 30320 proposal over a 30326 ]-> the ceremony's room
 *                                                  "shall we say our room will sign with K?"
 *  ...the session runs, on gift wraps...
 *  everyone holds the signed 30326                 "the group says that room signs with K"
 *  ...somebody creates the room...
 *  everyone files it as the room appears           GroupKeyStateManager.adopt
 * ```
 *
 * A room *is* its key, so this can be signed before the room exists and checked
 * without it: everything a reader needs is the event. See
 * `GroupKeyStateManager` for why the order was turned around.
 *
 * Content is the group's ChillDKG threshold public key; the tags name the
 * ceremony that produced it and the path the room's id was derived at.
 *
 * ### What it is for
 *
 * A signer holds a different secret share under every ceremony it took part in,
 * and signing with the wrong one produces a partial signature that cannot
 * aggregate. This is the record that says which. A member reads the state,
 * follows [FrostKeyTag] to the `DkgSession` row their own device already holds,
 * and takes the share from there -- the association travels, the share does not.
 *
 * Nothing secret is in here, and that is not an accident. Every member of the
 * room can read it, so a share put on this event would be every member holding
 * every other member's share, which is a 1-of-n key wearing a t-of-n's clothes.
 *
 * ### Trusted no further than it can be checked
 *
 * Two independent checks, and a state has to pass both -- see [isSignedByGroup]
 * and `GroupKeyState.verifies`.
 *
 * The derivation is the older one and still the load-bearing one: the room's id
 * *is* the threshold key derived at the path, so
 * `SharedKeyDerivation.marmotGroupId(content, path) == chatRoomId` has to hold.
 * A state that fails it names a key the room was not made from, whoever signed
 * it.
 *
 * The signature is what the proposal flow adds. A state now carries a BIP-340
 * signature by the key that same derivation reaches -- which, since a room's id
 * *is* that key, means a state is signed by the room it is about, and no single
 * member can produce it. So a member cannot decide on their own what the room
 * signs with, even truthfully. The two checks answer different questions and
 * neither replaces the other: the derivation says the state is true, the
 * signature says the group said it.
 *
 * ### Replaceable, by this app rather than by a relay
 *
 * Like every kind in [FrostSigningEvents] this only ever lives inside an
 * encryption a relay cannot open -- a Marmot group event, or the gift wrap the
 * proposal for it travels in -- so no relay sees it and the addressable
 * semantics of the 3xxxx range never fire. [DTag] is the room id and the newest
 * state per room wins, which the local store enforces on its own. Being able to
 * say it twice is what matters in practice: a session replayed after a crash, or
 * a second proposal for the same true state, folds away instead of accumulating.
 *
 * One room only ever names one key today. A group that re-runs its ceremony
 * derives a *different* room from the new key, so rotation in place does not
 * arise -- and if it ever does, the verification above is what has to change
 * first, because a rotated key no longer derives the room it names.

     * ### Why a room id is enough
     *
     * A room's id *is* the group's threshold key derived at the room's path --
     * see `shared-key-derivation.md`, and `GroupKeyState.verifies` and
     * `FrostSigningManager.signingPath`, both of which hold that invariant from
     * their own ends. So the key a signature has to verify against is not looked
     * up; it is the id of the room the event was found in.
     *
     * That is what makes a group's signature checkable by a member holding
     * nothing else. No `GroupKeyState` row, no threshold key, no derivation path,
     * no ceremony -- which is exactly the position a member added after the
     * ceremony is in, and the reason `docs/member-chronicle.md` can hand them
     * history without asking them to trust whoever sent it.
     *
     * Everything is caught, because every input is off the wire: a pubkey that
     * is not a point, a signature that is not 64 bytes, hex that is not hex.
     * All of them mean the same thing here, which is no.
