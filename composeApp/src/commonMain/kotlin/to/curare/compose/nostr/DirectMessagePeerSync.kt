/**
 * Asking the relays for what a direct message with one person needs.
 *
 * Two asks, because two sets of relays hold two different things. The DM relays
 * hold the key package and the DM relay list, and the kind 0 of anyone who has
 * published one here; the indexer relays hold everyone's kind 0 and nothing else a
 * chat needs. A three-kind filter to the indexers comes back with the kind 0 alone;
 * a kind-0-only filter to our relay finds a person who has never opened Curare
 * nowhere.
 *
 * Both at level 0, for the reason `MemberProfileSync` gives: it marks a request as
 * one somebody is waiting on, and a kind 0 arriving at level 0 over a placeholder
 * queues the rest of that person's profile kinds off the back of it
 * (`NostrDao.indexNostrEvent`). From an indexer that follow-up asks the indexer for
 * key packages it does not hold, which is harmless and is why [requests] is queued
 * explicitly rather than relied on.
 *
 * See docs/npub-profile-preview.md.
