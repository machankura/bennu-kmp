/**
 * A one-to-one message carried inside a Marmot group, as the application payload of a
 * kind:445 group event. See docs/marmot-direct-messages.md.
 *
 * The message is a stock NIP-59 gift wrap: a throwaway-keyed kind:1059 around a
 * sender-signed kind:13 seal around the kind:14 rumor that holds the words. Every member
 * of the group decrypts the MLS layer and sees the wrap; only the recipient can open it.
 *
 * What carries the wrap depends on the room's profile. A legacy room carries the wrap
 * itself as the payload -- signed by its throwaway key, with a `pubkey` that names
 * nobody -- which is what every build before docs/marmot-v2.md Phase 2 sent and reads,
 * and what the carve-out in `MarmotInboundManager.mip03Rejection` exists to admit. A
 * current-profile room carries it inside an [envelope]: an unsigned Marmot app event of
 * [ENVELOPE_KIND] whose `pubkey` is the sender's account and whose `content` is the
 * wrap's JSON. A conformant decoder refuses a payload with a `sig` member and one whose
 * author is not the MLS sender, and the wrap fails both; the envelope passes both, and
 * keeps every property the wrap was chosen for -- see docs/marmot-direct-messages.md --
 * because the envelope is unsigned and so a claim rather than a proof, and the wrap
 * inside it is still signed by nobody.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of its arguments, with no database and no MLS state,
 * which is what makes it testable — Room-backed code cannot be unit-tested in this project.
 *
 * **Nothing built here may ever be broadcast.** It is a genuine, correctly signed NIP-59
 * gift wrap, indistinguishable from one the NIP-17 path would be right to publish, so the
 * only thing keeping it off a relay is the tables it is kept out of: a Marmot direct
 * message lives in `MarmotInnerEvent`, never in `GiftWrapPayload` or `GiftWrapMessage`.
