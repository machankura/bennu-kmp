/**
 * Asking the relays who a room's members are, for the members this device cannot name.
 *
 * A pubkey gets a Profile row the moment it is first seen, and that row is a
 * placeholder: the "LOADING..." display name, stamped [GENESIS_AT] so it is
 * distinguishable from a profile actually read off a kind:0. What replaces it is a
 * kind:0, and every path that mints a placeholder asks for one -- exactly once, on
 * whichever relay that pubkey happened to arrive on.
 *
 * One ask is enough for a NIP-17 room only by accident. Opening one fetches each
 * member's kind:10050, and indexing any event authored by a pubkey we hold a
 * placeholder for re-queues the full profile sync (see `NostrDao.indexNostrEvent`),
 * so the name still arrives on the second bounce when the first ask came back empty.
 *
 * A Marmot group gets no such bounce. Its members never author anything this device
 * indexes -- a kind:445 is signed by a throwaway key and the sender's real identity
 * lives inside the MLS frame -- so the single ask made at the Welcome, or at the
 * commit that added them, is the only one there will ever be. Lose it to a relay that
 * did not hold their kind:0 yet and that member reads "LOADING..." for as long as the
 * room does.
 *
 * Hence asking again from what is on screen, rather than only from what just arrived.
