/**
 * The one filter shape that can return a NIP-17 message we are able to read.
 *
 * A gift wrap hides everything except who it is for. The author is the throwaway
 * key [GiftWrapEvent.create] mints and discards, the content is sealed to the
 * recipient, and `created_at` is randomised up to two days into the past. That
 * leaves the `p` tag as the only clause worth writing, and it has to name us:
 * naming a peer subscribes to mail no key of ours can open, and adding `authors`
 * matches nothing on any relay, ever. Both mistakes were live in three separate
 * call sites, so the filter is built in one place now and asserted in one place.

     * Two types for one filter is not a duplication worth removing: a
     * [SynchronizationFilter] is what the request queue stores and what
     * `computeId` hashes, while a live subscription puts a quartz `Filter`
     * straight onto the wire. Keeping both here is what stops them drifting —

     * NIP-01 scopes `limit` to the stored events a relay sends before EOSE and
     * explicitly not to the stream after it, so it bounds what a reconnect costs
     * without capping anything that arrives live.
