/**
 * The kind:0 a group signed about itself, as the group signed it.
 *
 * A Marmot room's id *is* the nostr pubkey it signs as -- see
 * `docs/shared-key-derivation.md`, where those are one value -- so the group has
 * an identity on nostr whether or not it has ever said anything about it. This is
 * what it says: a name, a picture, a line about what the group is for, authored by
 * the group rather than by whichever member typed it.
 *
 * ### Why this reads off [GroupSignedEvent] and not off `Profile`
 *
 * A `Profile` row hangs off a `NostrEvent` by foreign key, and a group-signed
 * event is not a `NostrEvent`: no member sent it, it never travelled on the wire
 * as itself, and the outbound pipeline would re-author it as its sender and strip
 * the group's signature off. See `GroupSignedEvent`, which exists for exactly the
 * events in that position. So the group's profile lives where the group's other
 * signed statements live, and this is the reading of it.
 *
 * The consequence worth stating: **nothing here has reached a relay.** A member's
 * kind:0 is published and is how the rest of nostr learns their name; a group's is
 * signed and kept, and every device that followed the signing session -- or was
 * handed the event afterwards -- holds it. Publishing it would mean a `NostrEvent`
 * row for an event no member authored, which is a decision this does not make.
 *
 * ### What a reading has to earn
 *
 * [GroupSignedEvent.verifies] and nothing less: the author has to be the room, the
 * id has to be the hash of the fields beside it, and the signature has to verify.
 * That is what makes this the *group's* profile rather than a kind:0 that happened
 * to be filed against the room -- and it is checkable from the row alone, with no
 * ceremony or key state to consult first.
 *
 * A room never derived from its group's key signs as the bare threshold key rather
 * than as its own id, so it has no profile *for its own pubkey* and gets none
 * here. That is the derivation's limit rather than this reader's, and it is the
 * same limit `GroupSignedEvent.verifies` documents.
