/**
 * Where this page sits in its chronicle, and how many there are.
 *
 * The count is what lets a receiver say whether it holds a whole chronicle, which
 * is the only question it can answer about completeness on its own. It cannot
 * tell whether the *sender* left anything out -- see the note on omission in
 * docs/member-chronicle.md -- so this is a claim about the transfer, not about the
 * group's record.
 *
 * The index is not an ordering instruction. Pages apply in whatever order they
 * arrive and the sweep resolves what could not be applied yet, because relays
 * give no ordering guarantee and a design that needed one would be wrong on the
 * wire rather than merely slow.
