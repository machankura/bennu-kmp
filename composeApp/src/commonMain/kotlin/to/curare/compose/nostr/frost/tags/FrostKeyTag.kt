 * Which key the group is being asked to sign with, named by the ceremony that
 * created it.
 *
 * A group can hold more than one shared key -- a ceremony is re-runnable, and
 * a member leaving is a reason to run another -- and a signer holds a
 * different secret share under each. Signing with the share from the wrong
 * ceremony produces a partial signature that cannot aggregate, so the session
 * says which one from the start rather than leaving each device to guess at
 * its most recent.
