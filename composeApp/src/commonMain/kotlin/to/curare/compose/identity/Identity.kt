/**
 * Where an identity's key came from, which decides what else it can have.
 *
 * The distinction is not cosmetic: the nostr key is a BIP32 leaf of the seed at
 * `m/44'/1237'/0'/0/0`, and that derivation runs one way. Twelve words yield the
 * key and a wallet; a bare key yields nothing further, so an identity made from
 * one can never grow a node behind it; and a bare public key yields nothing at all,
 * not even a signature. See docs/nsec-sign-in.md and docs/npub-sign-in.md.

 *
 * This is what every consumer of "the active user" reads, in place of reaching
 * through the wallet -- `business.walletManager.keyManager.value.nostrPrivateKey()`
 * -- for a key that only some identities derive that way. Everything downstream of
 * the key is already independent of the seed: the notary and the sync pumps build
 * a quartz `KeyPair` from its bytes, the ChillDKG host key is a hash of it, and the
 * Marmot bundle password is `hash160` of it. None of them can tell where it came
 * from, and after this type none of them need to.
 *
 * [nostrPublicKey] is a field rather than a derivation because a read-only identity
 * has nothing to derive it from. The two checks in `init` keep the field and the key
 * from disagreeing, which a data class would otherwise happily allow; [signing] and
 * [readOnly] are the two ways to get one built without tripping them.
 *
 * @param id keys the per-identity preference files and the wallet metadata. For a
 *   [IdentityKind.Mnemonic] identity it is the hash160 of the node id, as it always
 *   was; for the two bare kinds it is the hash160 of the x-only public key
 *   ([toWalletId]) -- the *same* id whether the device holds the secret or only the
 *   public key, which is what lets a read-only identity become a signing one and keep
 *   its preferences. Same shape as a wallet's, so nothing downstream can tell the
 *   kinds apart by the id -- the kind is here, where it can be asked.
 * @param nostrPrivateKey null only for [IdentityKind.NostrPublic].
 * @param business the running node. Non-null only for [IdentityKind.Mnemonic].
