 * proposal waiting on *this* member is `COLLECTING_NONCES` like every other open
 * one, and what sets it apart is `FrostSigningSession.signApprovedAt` and
 * `signDeclinedAt` being null. So [NEEDS_YOU] cannot be read off the stage at
 * all, and a filter keyed on the enum would be a filter missing its reason to
 * exist.
 *
 * Exhaustive and in lifecycle order, which is the order the chips are offered
 * in.
