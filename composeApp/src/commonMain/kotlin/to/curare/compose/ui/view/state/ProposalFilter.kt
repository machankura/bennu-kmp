/**
 * Which proposals the reader has asked to see.
 *
 * A flat enum rather than `All` plus a [ProposalState], because every filter
 * this screen has is a state and the wrapper would be a type to unwrap at every
 * call site for no fact it could hold. [state] is null on [ALL] and that is the
 * whole of the difference.
 *
 * Offered in this order, which is [ProposalState]'s order behind [ALL]: most
 * asked of the reader first, because the reason to come here with a filter in
 * mind is almost always [NEEDS_YOU].
