/**
 * Asks the group to say something publicly, in its own name.
 *
 * The post is not written here and does not exist yet. What goes out is a proposal
 * to sign one, and the post appears -- on every member's device at once, authored by
 * the room's own key rather than by whoever typed it -- when enough members have
 * signed. That author is the room's id: signing runs at the path the room was
 * derived at, so a post says which group made it simply by being signed.
 *
 * That is the difference from a message in the room. A message is a member speaking
 * where the group can hear; this is the group speaking where anyone can, and it
 * takes a quorum to say.
