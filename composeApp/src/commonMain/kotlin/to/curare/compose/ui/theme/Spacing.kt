/**
 * M3's spacing scale, and the semantic names layered over it.
 *
 * `MaterialTheme` has no spacing slot, so this rides a composition local beside it, the
 * same way [ExtendedColors] does. [CurareTheme] provides it.
 *
 * **The scale** is M3's own, an 8dp system where `space100 = 8dp`, including the sub-8
 * nested units Material defines because its components need them. Numbers are from
 * m3.material.io/m3/pages/spacing/tokens, read September 2026; see
 * docs/material-design-conformance.md for the full table.
 *
 * **Why a `data class` and not constants.** So that a different instance can be provided
 * without touching a call site, which is what [spacingFor] now does per [Breakpoint] and
 * what M3's density setting for data-heavy views would do next. A file of top-level
 * `val`s would read the same at the call site and adapt to nothing.

    // `space125` at a call site is no more readable than `10.dp` -- it says the size and
    // not the job. These say the job, and they are what call sites should reach for; the
    // raw scale is for the cases none of them fits.
    //
    // The distinction M3 draws, and the reason the names are split this way:
    //
    //   padding  space inside an element, between its edge and its content
    //   gap      space between elements in a row, column or grid
    //   margin   space outside an element, between it and its parent or the screen
    //
    // The spec is explicit that margins are a last resort -- "define padding and gaps on
    // the parent container", "avoid defining margins on child elements as they usually
    // aren't uniform, and require more tokens" -- so there is exactly one margin here,
    // for the screen edge, and everything else is padding or a gap.

    // They are constructor parameters rather than `get()`s over the scale so that a
    // breakpoint can reassign one without moving the stop underneath it. That direction
    // matters: M3's spacing tokens are absolute values that do not change with window
    // width -- `space200` is 16dp on a phone and 16dp on a desktop -- and what adapts is
    // which token a given job reaches for. A wider window takes a wider screen margin, it
    // does not take a wider 16.
    //
    // Kotlin resolves a default expression against the parameters before it, so each of
    // these still reads its stop by name and follows it when the scale itself is
    // overridden. `Spacing(space200 = 24.dp)` still moves `screenMargin`.

 * The spacing a window at [breakpoint] should use.

 * breakpoint -- 16dp compact, 24dp everywhere wider -- and publishes nothing else that
 * varies with window width: padding inside a card and the gap between two list rows are
 * component decisions, and a card does not become a different component because the
 * window grew. Widening them all would be the "everything breathes on a big screen"
 * instinct, which reads as a zoomed phone rather than as a layout.
 *
 * What actually fills a wide window is a second pane and a bounded measure, not fatter
 * gaps. Those are layout, and they live in `AdaptiveContent` rather than here.
