/**
 * Somewhere to say what just happened.
 *
 * The app had **no** `Snackbar`, `SnackbarHost` or `SnackbarHostState` anywhere, across 26
 * `Scaffold`s. Every transient outcome -- an invite that failed, a key package published,
 * a message that did not send -- had nowhere to be reported, so the code either said
 * nothing or navigated away and hoped.
 *
 * M3 puts a snackbar host in the `Scaffold` for this, and the reason it is a composition
 * local rather than a parameter is where the reporting happens: a view model coroutine
 * finishing a network call is several composables below the `Scaffold` that owns the host.
 * Threading a `SnackbarHostState` down through every screen's parameter list would be the
 * same plumbing repeated 26 times, and the parameter would be forgotten on the 27th.
 *
 * ```
 * Scaffold(snackbarHost = { SnackbarHost(LocalSnackbarHostState.current) }) { … }
 * …
 * val notify = rememberNotifier()
 * notify("Invite sent")
 * ```
