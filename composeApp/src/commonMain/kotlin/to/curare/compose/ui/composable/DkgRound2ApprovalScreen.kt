/**
 * Asks whether to confirm the combined result.
 *
 * The one approval of the three that is a check rather than a decision. Every
 * member signs to say the coordinator's combined result matches what they
 * themselves sent, and it is that agreement — not the coordinator's word — which
 * makes the key final. A coordinator trying to substitute a key the members never
 * contributed to is caught precisely here.
 *
 * The check itself is done by the device, which has the member's own round-1
 * message to compare against and would refuse a mismatch outright. So this screen
 * is not asking the member to verify anything by eye; it is asking whether to put
 * their name to a result their device has already found consistent.
