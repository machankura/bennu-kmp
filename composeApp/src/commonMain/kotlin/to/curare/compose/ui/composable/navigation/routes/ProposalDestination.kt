/**
 * Where tapping a proposal in the transcript goes.
 *
 * Three answers, and they are three because the tap means three different
 * things. Pulled out of the screen so each can be stated once and checked: the
 * decision is made from two facts and a null, and a `when` buried in a lambda
 * nested nine deep inside a `LazyColumn` is not a thing anybody can hold to it.
 *
 * @param sessionId the proposal the tapped line names, or null when it predates
 *   chat rows naming their session at all.
 * @param hasOtherDecisionsWaiting whether opening that proposal by itself would
 *   hide other decisions the room is waiting on this member for -- see
 *   `ChatMessageListViewModel.hidesOtherDecisions`, which is what the screen
 *   passes.
