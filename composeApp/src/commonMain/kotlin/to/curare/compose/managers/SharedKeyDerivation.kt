/**
 * Keys derived from a group's ChillDKG threshold key by FROST tweaks.
 *
 * A derived key here is a real key the group can sign with: each step applies an
 * additive tweak, `K' = K + t·G`, which every signer can apply to their own share
 * at signing time. The [TweakCache] is what carries that, and a signing session
 * needs the cache these functions return -- not just the public key.
 *
 * Everything is a pure function of the threshold key and the path, so every
 * member's device computes the same result with no agreement round, and nothing
 * has to be stored. Rederive rather than persist.
 *
 * ### Why this is not BIP32, and why it needs no chain code
 *
 * The paths read like BIP32 and are walked the same way, index by index, but a
 * BIP32 node is a key *and* a chain code and ChillDKG produces no chain code.
 * BIP32 wants one only because it computes the tweak scalar for you:
 *
 *     t = HMAC-SHA512(chaincode, serP(K_par) || ser32(i))[0:32]
 *
 * A FROST tweak takes that scalar as an input, so choosing it directly removes
 * the chain code from the problem entirely. It also removes the trap BIP32 would
 * bring here: with x-only keys there is no single obvious `serP(K_par)`, and two
 * devices picking different parity conventions would silently derive different
 * keys rather than fail.
 *
 * ### The security property this inherits
 *
 * Additive tweaking is exactly what non-hardened BIP32 does, and it carries the
 * same weakness: `k' = k + t` with a publicly computable `t` inverts, so anyone
 * who learns one derived private key recovers the threshold key and can sign as
 * the group without any quorum at all. Hardened derivation is not available --
 * it needs the parent private key, which by construction nobody has.
 *
 * So the rule is: never reconstruct a derived key in the clear. Any path that
 * could -- an export, a "reveal private key" screen, a test helper -- leaks the
 * group key, not just the key it appears to expose.
