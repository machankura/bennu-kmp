/**
 * Signs a nostr event with a group's FROST threshold key, in one of its rooms.
 *
 * The shape is [ChillDkgRitualManager]'s, deliberately: the member who proposes
 * a signature coordinates it, protocol messages travel on the kinds in
 * [FrostSigningEvents], each inbound message is persisted and then the session
 * is asked whether it can move, and every step is recomputed from stored inputs
 * so a device killed mid-round resumes on the next message. What that manager's
 * own notes say about being message-driven applies here unchanged.
 *
 * ### Two transports, because a group signs before it has a room
 *
 * Almost every signature is made in the group's admin room, and there a
 * signing message is an ordinary Marmot inner event needing no addressing of its
 * own: the room already exists, its membership is exactly the share holders, and
 * its id is derived from the key. One encrypted group event reaches everyone.
 *
 * The exception is the group's *first* signature. A room's `GroupKeyState` is
 * now signed before the room it is about is created -- see
 * `GroupKeyStateManager.propose` -- so that session runs wherever the ceremony
 * ran: the members' NIP-17 room for a group's own key, where there is no MLS
 * tree and a message goes out as one sealed gift wrap per member, and the
 * parent's Marmot room for a subgroup's, where it is an ordinary group event.
 * [broadcast] is the only place that knows the difference; everything above it
 * is the same protocol either way.
 *
 * ### What it signs as
 *
 * The room's own key, not the group's root threshold key. A signing session is
 * created with the [SharedKeyDerivation] cache for the path the room was derived
 * at, so the `pubkey` on every event a room signs is that room's id -- see
 * [SharedKeyDerivation.marmotGroupId], where those are one value. A reader
 * holding a signed dialect therefore needs no lookup to check it: the author
 * they expect is the id of the room they found it in.
 *
 * A session in a ceremony's own room signs as the room that ceremony's key
 * derives -- the admin room that does not exist yet -- which is the same rule
 * read forwards: what a group signs as is the room the signature belongs to.
 *
 * The path comes from the room, never from a proposal -- [signingPath] -- because
 * it decides which key the group signs as.
 *
 * ### It signs a batch
 *
 * A session carries one or more events as [FrostSigningItem] rows, and runs one
 * FROST instance per event in lockstep: one signer set, one aggregate per item,
 * one partial signature per item per signer, one approval. Four group events
 * whatever the size, instead of four per event.
 *
 * That is all the batching there is, and all there can be. A Schnorr partial
 * signature is `s = k + e·x` with `e = H(R‖P‖m)`, so two messages under one
 * nonce give two equations in one unknown and the secret share falls out; a
 * batch shares only what is outside that equation. Every item has its own seed,
 * its own aggregate and its own `Session`, and [joinPayload] is the only place
 * they travel together.
 *
 * Three things are genuinely different from a ceremony, and each of them is why
 * this is a separate manager rather than another branch of that one.
 *
 * ### It does not need everybody
 *
 * A DKG cannot finish until every member takes part; that is what makes the key.
 * Signing with a t-of-n key needs t, and waiting for n would throw away the
 * property the group ran a ceremony to get. So the coordinator waits for the
 * threshold to be reachable, picks a signer set, and says who is in it. Members
 * outside the set do nothing and are not stalling anything.
 *
 * The same arithmetic runs the other way. A member who refuses takes one of
 * the n away rather than ending the session, and it is abandoned only once
 * fewer than t are left who could still sign -- see [recordDecline]. In a
 * 2-of-3 group one refusal is nothing the other two cannot sign around; the
 * second is the one that ends it.
 *
 * ### Restart-safety is forced, not chosen
 *
 * `SecretNonce` cannot be serialised and refuses to be used twice. Storing the
 * randomness it is derived from and regenerating on demand is the only way a
 * signing session can survive the app closing -- and it is safe only because an
 * item signs one message and cannot be made to sign another. See
 * [FrostSigningSession] for the two rules that hold that in place; both are
 * enforced here, in [acceptProposal] and in [record].
 *
 * ### One approval, not three
 *
 * A DKG asks three times because each step publishes something different and
 * commits the member to something different. Here every step serves one
 * decision -- sign these events or do not -- and they are fixed before the
 * member is asked. A second prompt would be the same question again. That holds
 * for a batch only as long as the member can see every event in it before
 * answering, which is the screen's side of the bargain.

     * The key a room signs with, or null when it has none.
     *
     * Signing usually runs in the admin room, which is never where the ceremony
     * ran: the admin room's id is derived from the key the ceremony produces, so
     * it cannot exist until afterwards. A group's own ceremony runs in the NIP-17
     * room its members share; a subgroup's runs in its parent's Marmot room.
     *
     * They are bound together by the room's [GroupKeyState]: the statement the
     * room opened with and the group signed, naming the ceremony behind it. That
     * is a lookup rather than a search, and it carries the derivation path, so a
     * room derived anywhere other than [SharedKeyDerivation.MARMOT_ADMIN_GROUP_PATH]
     * is findable at all -- which the rederivation below cannot manage, since it
     * can only rederive at the one path the constant names.
     *
     * The state buys none of its authority from being written down. It is only
     * ever stored having rederived the room it describes, so what actually binds
     * a room to a key is still that the room's id *is* the key, and a room still
     * cannot be pointed at a key it was not derived from.
     *
     * Two fallbacks behind it. The first is the original scan over every
     * ceremony this device holds a share for, rederiving each one's room id
     * until one matches; the second is a ceremony held in this very room, which
     * is not how the app wires things today but costs one lookup to keep honest.
     *
     * That second one asks for the room's *own* ceremony, and the distinction is
     * load-bearing now rather than pedantic. A parent's Marmot room hosts the
     * ChillDKG of every subgroup it makes, so it holds completed ceremonies whose
     * key belongs to a child; handing one back here would have the parent sign as
     * its own subgroup, silently, for every member who holds no key-state row --
     * which is every member welcomed after the parent's own ceremony. A ceremony
     * naming a parent is never the room's own key, and that is all it takes to
     * tell them apart.
     *
     * They are not only for rooms that predate the table. A room's key state is
     * signed before the room exists and filed as the room is created, so a
     * device that missed that session -- a member invited later, a reinstall --
     * has a room and no state, and the scan is what keeps it usable.
     * `GroupKeyStateManager.propose` is the one caller that does not come
     * through here at all, because it names the ceremony outright: the room it
     * runs in is the NIP-17 room the ceremony was held in, which signs nothing
     * else and has no key state of its own.

     * Whichever answers, it answers the same thing: two paths reaching one key
     * is not a thing that happens.
     *
     * Nothing here comes off a proposal. The path decides what key the group
     * signs as, so a proposer able to choose it could have every signer put
     * their share behind an author of the proposer's choosing.
     *
     * ### The room a group signs from before it has one
     *
     * One case cannot be self-checked, because there is nothing yet to check
     * against: the room a ceremony ran in, signing the very statement that lets
     * the room the ceremony's key derives be created -- see
     * `GroupKeyStateManager.propose`. What the group signs as there is the room
     * it is about to make: the ceremony's key at the app's admin path.
     *
     * Two rooms are that room. A group's own ceremony runs in the NIP-17 room its
     * members share, whose id is an aggregation of their keys, so it is derived
     * from nothing and no path reaches it. A *subgroup's* ceremony runs in the
     * parent's Marmot room, which is derived from the parent's key and so reaches
     * itself at some path -- just never from the child's, which is the key being
     * signed under here.
     *
     * Each is admitted on the narrowest thing that identifies it, and the path is
     * the constant rather than anything off the wire. Every input is read from
     * this device's own database, so a proposer still chooses nothing: naming
     * some other ceremony this device holds a share for gets no path at all, and
     * a session with no path signs as the bare threshold key, which is not an
     * identity any room answers to.
     *
     * `key.parentChatRoomId` is the unverified claim off a proposal, and admitting
     * it here grants nothing. The signature it enables is by the child's key over
     * the child's own id -- both derived from a ceremony every signer contributed
     * to -- so a member who put a false parent on a proposal gets a key state for
     * a room made from a key they helped make, which is what they would have got
     * by telling the truth.
     *
     * Null is not a failure. `completedKey` will find a key for a Marmot room
     * that was never derived from it -- the fallback kept for rooms the app no
     * longer makes -- and such a room has no key of its own to sign as, so it
     * signs as the group's threshold key, which is what it always did.

     * A member can be left with nothing at all for a session they would have
     * agreed to. Several ways, and only some of them heal on their own: a group
     * event that decrypted to nothing because MLS had moved its ratchet past the
     * generation it arrived at, which is terminal at the receiver and invisible
     * to the sender (`docs/mls-skipped-keys.md`); a disappearing-message group
     * whose kind:445 expired off the relay before they synced; a member added to
     * the room after the proposal, holding a share from an earlier ceremony. In
     * each of them the session sits in [FrostSigningStage.COLLECTING_NONCES]
     * until somebody gives up, and the member it was waiting on never knew.
     *
     * A resend repairs all three because a resent message is a *new* message:
     * new `created_at`, new id, encrypted at a generation the receiver has not
     * passed, carrying a fresh expiry.
     *
     * ### Only this device's own messages, and only the coordinator's
     *
     * What goes out is the proposal, the signer set and the signature -- the
     * three the coordinator authors. A member's nonce, partial signature or
     * refusal is not resent and cannot be: [record] files a signer's message
     * under the inner event's own `pubKey`, so a relayed copy would be filed
     * under the relayer, and for a refusal that is a way to manufacture one.
     * Nor is there a need. A nonce and a partial signature are read by nobody
     * but the coordinator -- [orderedNonces] and [orderedPartialSignatures] are
     * both called under `isCoordinator` -- and the coordinator already holds
     * them, which is how it knows who is quiet. What the resend does for a
     * silent member instead is name them, in `FrostSilentMembersTag`, so their
     * own device republishes what it already said. See [republishOwn].
     *
     * Coordinator-only, and that is correctness rather than etiquette.
     * [acceptProposal] takes `coordinatorPublicKey` from the proposal's author,
     * so a non-coordinator resending it to a member with no session row would
     * have that member believe the resender coordinates -- and then drop the
     * real coordinator's signer set through [isFromCoordinator].
     *
     * ### Who it goes to
     *
     * [membersOwing], which asks what the stage makes sense of: who has said
     * nothing at all while nonces are being collected, and which of the chosen
     * signers has yet to sign once they have been chosen. The first question
     * asked at the second stage names only members who owe nothing, which is
     * how a session could sit in [FrostSigningStage.COLLECTING_PARTIAL_SIGNATURES]
     * with a control that refused to knock.
     *
     * ### The minimum the stage requires
     *
     * | stage | what goes out |
     * |---|---|
     * | [FrostSigningStage.COLLECTING_NONCES] | the proposal |
     * | [FrostSigningStage.COLLECTING_PARTIAL_SIGNATURES] | the proposal, then the signer set |
     * | [FrostSigningStage.COMPLETE] | the proposal, then the signature |
     * | [FrostSigningStage.FAILED] | nothing -- refused |
     *
     * The proposal goes in every case because a device with no session row can
     * apply nothing else: a signer set naming ids it has no items for, and a
     * signature over events it has never seen, are both dropped.
     * [FrostSigningStage.COMPLETE] is worth repeating rather than skipping --
     * a member who never received the signature never ran [complete], so the
     * signed events were never applied to their store.
     *
     * Two and not three, deliberately. Publishing in bursts is what the
     * skipped-keys bug feeds on, and a recovery for it that re-creates it is no
     * recovery. `MlsGroupCache` covers a burst decrypted in one sync, which is
     * what makes [proposeSigningBatch]'s own two-message burst work; this stays
     * inside the same budget.
     *
     * A failed session is refused rather than repaired. Its items' nonce seeds
     * have been published against an aggregate already, so the retry is a fresh
     * proposal and never this one again -- which is what [fail] tells the group.

     * added after its key was made who hold no share, and a subgroup's ceremony
     * room is the parent, which holds everybody the subgroup is not. A door that
     * cannot answer is not one to knock on.
     *
     * ### The question changes when the stage does
     *
     * While nonces are being collected the question is who has said *nothing*,
     * and a member with any message on file has answered it.
     *
     * Past that point that reading is not merely imprecise, it is inverted. A
     * session reaches [FrostSigningStage.COLLECTING_PARTIAL_SIGNATURES] only
     * because enough members offered a nonce, so everybody who could be holding
     * it up has been heard from -- and asking who is silent returns the members
     * who were never chosen and owe nothing, while the chosen signer whose
     * partial signature went missing is never named. That is a knock on the
     * wrong door; and once the unchosen have answered or refused it is no knock
     * at all, because the set is empty and [resend] gives up before it reaches
     * the stage it was written for.
     *
     * So the later stage asks its own question: of the signers the coordinator
     * chose, who has yet to send a partial signature. Naming them is the half of
     * a resend that only they can carry out -- a partial signature is read by
     * nobody but the coordinator, so one lost on the way here can be repeated by
     * no other device. See [republishOwn].
     *
     * [FrostSigningStage.COMPLETE] keeps the first reading, and correctly: the
     * signature is the coordinator's own and nobody answers it, so having heard
     * nothing at all is still exactly what it means to have missed the session.
     *
     * A member who declined is never here, at either stage. They answered, and
     * the session is counting their refusal; knocking again would be asking a
     * question they have already closed.
