/**
 * Which of this device's KeyPackage bundles a Welcome is addressed to.
 *
 * A Welcome's `e` tag names the kind:30443 the inviter *thinks* it consumed, and
 * that can be wrong: MDK stamps the event id of the copy cached in its user
 * directory, so a peer that rotated its published KeyPackage while an inviter kept
 * inviting from cache is unjoinable by the tag alone. The Welcome itself is the
 * authority. RFC 9420 §12.4.3.1 has the joiner walk its `EncryptedGroupSecrets`
 * in order and take the first whose `new_member` is a KeyPackageRef it holds the
 * private keys for -- which is what OpenMLS does, and what quartz's own inbound
 * processor does before it falls back to the tag.
 *
 * Pure: a Welcome in, a choice out, no database. The refs are compared over the
 * bundle's stored KeyPackage bytes, decoded through [KeyPackageUtils.decodeKeyPackage]
 * so a bundle stored framed (the current profile's shape) and one stored bare (the
 * legacy shape) both resolve.
 *
 * See docs/marmot-v2.md, Phase 1.
