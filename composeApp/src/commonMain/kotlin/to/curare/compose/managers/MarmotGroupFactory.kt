/**
 * The one place a Marmot group is minted, on whichever profile new rooms are on.
 *
 * Three sites make rooms -- a direct message, the "convenient" room, and the derived
 * room `MarmotGroupCreation` builds around a threshold key -- and each used to hand
 * `MlsGroup.create` a `0xF2EE` extension of its own. The current profile is not one
 * more extension: epoch 0 carries `required_capabilities` naming extension `0x0006`
 * and proposal `0x0008`, a GroupContext dictionary with the required-component list,
 * the admin policy, the routing and the profile, and the creator's leaf with its
 * account identity proof -- and no `0xF2EE` at all, because RFC 9420 requires every
 * member to support every GroupContext extension and an MDK leaf does not advertise
 * it. So the profile is decided here, once, from [MarmotProfile.DEFAULT_FOR_NEW_ROOMS]
 * unless a caller says otherwise, and the three sites only say what the room is.
 *
 * **The routing id.** A legacy room's `nostr_group_id` is its room id; that is how
 * every room was keyed and how every other client keys the rooms it makes. A
 * current-profile room's is minted here at random, whatever its room id, because the
 * routing component says it must never be derived from a public key and the derived
 * room id is exactly that. The caller records the pair in `MarmotRouting`; the room
 * id stays the identity everything else is keyed on. See docs/marmot-v2.md, Phase 4.
