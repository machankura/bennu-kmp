/**
 * The fields of a group's Marmot state, read from whichever profile the group is on.
 *
 * A legacy (MIP-01) group keeps its name, description, admins, relays and retention
 * in one `0xF2EE` extension, which `MlsGroup.currentMarmotData()` reads. A
 * current-profile group keeps the same facts in separate components -- profile
 * `0x8001`, admin policy `0x8003`, routing `0x8004`, retention `0x8005` -- which
 * `MlsGroup.currentGroupState()` reads, and carries no `0xF2EE` at all. Every call
 * site that read only the first saw a current-profile group as nameless, adminless
 * and without a routing id, and the Welcome path threw on the last of those.
 *
 * Each accessor tries the current profile first and the legacy extension second,
 * written once here so the order cannot be forgotten at a call site. There is no
 * third case: a group carrying neither is not a Marmot group, and these return null
 * or empty for it rather than guessing.
 *
 * See docs/marmot-v2.md, Phase 1.

 * The id this group's room is keyed on.

 * A current-profile room this app created names its room id in its profile

 * `nostr_group_id`, from whichever profile carries it: a legacy room's derived or
 * random id, or the only id a room made by another client has. A group with neither,
 * which only a test builds, falls back to the MLS group id as every caller did before.
