/**
 * Creating a Marmot room at an id the group's key derives, once, for every flow
 * that needs one.
 *
 * Two do: the admin room a group opens after its own ceremony, and a subgroup,
 * which is the same act with four different values. This was 120 lines inside
 * `DkgRitualViewModel` and is here unchanged in behaviour, because the rules it
 * already gets right are not rules worth deriving twice.
 *
 * ### The three that are not obvious
 *
 * **Every key package before anything exists.** The id is derived, so there is
 * exactly one room per key at a path; a half-created one occupies that address
 * permanently and there is no second id to retry with. Better to create nothing
 * and name who is missing -- and better still to have checked at the picker, so
 * that a subgroup does not discover it after three ceremonies. See
 * `docs/subgroups.md`.
 *
 * **`adminPubkeys` baked into the epoch-0 group context**, rather than added by a
 * later commit, so a member welcomed afterwards gets a populated group instead of
 * chasing a bootstrap commit that predates their membership. That is why
 * `MarmotGroupData` is built here rather than through `MarmotGroupData.bootstrap`,
 * which hardcodes a single admin.
 *
 * **[GroupKeyStateManager.adopt] before the members are added.** Filing the key
 * state is local and certain; adding members is a relay round trip that can
 * partly fail. Doing it first means the room comes into existence already knowing
 * what it signs with, whatever happens next.
 *
 * ### Derived ids make every step reachable twice
 *
 * A second tap, or another member having got there first, lands on the same id.
 * Joining what exists beats minting a rival group on one address, so [Existing]
 * is a success rather than a refusal.
