/**
 * Keeps a room's [MlsGroup] alive between messages instead of rebuilding it
 * from the stored state every time.
 *
 * ### The bug this exists for
 *
 * MLS is specified to tolerate out-of-order delivery within an epoch: a
 * receiver that gets generation N+1 before N derives and caches the key for N
 * so the older message can still be read when it turns up. Quartz's
 * `SecretTree` does exactly that, in a private `skippedKeys` map.
 *
 * `SecretTree.exportSenderStates()` does not include that map, so
 * `MlsGroup.saveState()` does not carry it. Rebuilding the group from stored
 * state therefore throws the skipped keys away, and a message for a generation
 * the ratchet has already passed fails
 * `require(generation >= state.applicationGeneration)` and is dropped. There is
 * no recovering it afterwards: the key is gone and the sender will not resend.
 *
 * Nostr relays offer no ordering whatsoever, so this is not an edge case. Two
 * events published in the same second race, and exactly one survives — which is
 * how a signing session's proposal was lost while the nonce sent immediately
 * behind it arrived fine.
 *
 * ### What this fixes, and what it does not
 *
 * Holding the instance means `skippedKeys` survives for as long as the process
 * does and nothing else writes the room's state. That covers the case that
 * actually bites — a burst of messages arriving in one sync — because they are
 * decrypted one after another against the same tree.
 *
 * It does not survive a restart, and it does not survive another writer, so
 * reordering across app launches still loses messages. The real fix is for
 * `exportSenderStates` to carry the skipped keys; see
 * `docs/mls-skipped-keys.md`.
 *
 * ### Staleness
 *
 * The group is only reused when the stored state is still exactly what this
 * cache last wrote. Anything else that saves a room's state — sending a message
 * advances the sender ratchet and saves, so does adding a member — changes the
 * hex, and the next read rebuilds rather than carrying on from a group that has
 * been overtaken. Losing the skipped keys there is the same behaviour as
 * before this existed, so the fallback is never worse than not caching.
