/**
 * quartz's Marmot engine, over this database, for the rooms on the current profile.
 *
 * `MlsGroupManager` holds the live `MlsGroup` of every group and persists through
 * [RoomMlsGroupStateStore]; `MarmotInboundProcessor` reads kind:445s against them,
 * settling same-epoch commits through its convergence engine and recognising
 * redelivery by the Marmot message id; `MarmotOutboundProcessor` builds the kind:445s
 * this device sends. Everything in docs/marmot-v2.md's "v2 says" column that is not a
 * wire shape lives in these three, and they are built around the store rather than
 * the app's own copy of their logic.
 *
 * **A room's profile picks its pipeline.** Legacy rooms keep the app's own path --
 * `MarmotInboundManager` over `MlsGroupCache`, unchanged -- and retire with it;
 * current-profile rooms go through here. A room is on one profile for its whole
 * life, so the two never hold the same group, which is what keeps the manager's live
 * instance the single writer of a current-profile room's state. The library's
 * processor also has no carve-out for the bare gift wrap a legacy room carries a
 * direct message in, which is the other reason legacy rooms stay where they are.
 *
 * One engine per database, owned by it ([CurareDatabase.marmotEngine]): the manager
 * keys groups by routing address, which is unique across identities, and a room row
 * belongs to one identity anyway.
 *
 * The library's KeyPackage rotation manager is constructed but not fed: Welcomes are
 * matched to this device's bundles by the app's own table, which is profile-aware
 * and matched by reference since Phase 1, and the processor reads the rotation
 * manager only on its own Welcome path, which the app does not use.
