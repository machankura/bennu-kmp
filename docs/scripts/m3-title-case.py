"""Find UI strings still written in title case.

M3's style guide: "All text, including titles, headings, labels, menu items, navigation
components, app bars, and buttons should use sentence-style capitalization." Product names
and branded terms keep their capitals.

Two things this gets right that the first, grep-based version did not:

  - It allows lowercase articles inside a title-cased phrase, so "Invite a Friend" is
    caught. Requiring every word after the first to be capitalised missed four strings.
  - It scans the whole file rather than one line at a time, so a `Text(` whose literal is
    on the next line is caught. That missed one more.

Sample data is excluded by name rather than by pattern, because "Steve Biko" and "To Kill
a Mockingbird" are title case for the correct reason: they are a person and a book.

Usage: m3-title-case.py [--list]
