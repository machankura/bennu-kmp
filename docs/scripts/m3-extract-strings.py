"""Move literal UI strings out of composables and into the resource catalogue.

Handles the simple case only: a `text = "..."` or `Text("...")` whose literal contains no
Kotlin interpolation. Interpolated strings need format placeholders and an argument order
decided per site, which is not something to do blind.

Resource names are derived from the string's content, snake_cased and truncated at a word
boundary. That is the conventional shape for an automated extraction and it has a known
cost: rewording the copy makes the name a little stale. The alternative -- a name derived
from the string's *purpose* -- needs somebody to read all 285 call sites, and a wrong
purpose in a name is worse than a slightly dated one.

Usage:
    m3-extract-strings.py            dry run, prints the plan
    m3-extract-strings.py --apply
