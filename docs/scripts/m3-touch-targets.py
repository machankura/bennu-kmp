"""Find `.clickable` chains with no minimum interactive size.

M3 asks for touch targets of at least 48x48dp and pointer targets of at least 44x44dp.
`Modifier.clickable` gives an element no minimum of its own, so a clickable `Text` is a
target the size of the text -- around 20dp here.

`minimumInteractiveComponentSize()` is a no-op on anything already 48dp or larger, so the
rule this checks is simply that every `.clickable` chain has it: correct everywhere, and
textual enough to enforce. It reserves *layout* space; touch expansion happens at the
input layer regardless, and the layout is what stops adjacent targets overlapping and what
a pointer on desktop has to land on.

Components that carry their own minimum -- IconButton, Button, Checkbox, ListItem and the
rest of material3 -- are not `.clickable` call sites and never appear here.

Usage: m3-touch-targets.py [--list]
